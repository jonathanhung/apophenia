"Can seek high returns, don't need altruism as aim"

I don't claim to know the truth of the counter-narrative. 

But we must be aware of the capital ideologies within the sustainability space: they are the invisible forces that constrain our action, the way we move, the things we build, the approaches we are forced into. 

How are we designing with time?
"Ten year timeframe"
Optimism (exponential growth and adoption) and fear of shortening horizon.

"Climate stability created economic stability" no, defuturing did. We took a loan out on the future and we can't pay it back. We went to war for oil; who exactly is stable?

## Industry is super broad
"Climate tech" is not "sustainability" is not "clean energy". At the funder level, at the community organizing level, there needs to be finer grained distinction. 


No one's talking about equity and democracy. Peer 2 peer. 

Shared values before shared industry



Making sustainability a financial solvency. 
Free market?? and business case 

Exponential growth is part of the problem. At least in terms of rate of return, profit seeking. Shifting consumption patterns. 
- Cost structure is cheapening...
- Deploying renewables is the most important factor. 

Don't need other motivations just investment. Drop altruism.

Austin as a hub: I live in energy country. 

Felt delusional; schizophrenic. 

Desire to build a slower, distributed, smaller future of prosperity.
