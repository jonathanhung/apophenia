The fundamental attribution error is one of the most important ideas in social psychology. Not because it explains, but because it holds a theory of cause that is deeply forgiving to the individual. 

We move towards compassion because we know some part of that person is just like me. Given the circumstances, what they've experienced, maybe I'd do the same. 

Perhaps the self righteousness, I've been there. There's a part of me. 

And yet the attribution error also avoids personal responsibility. It avoids choice making and stifles free will. Incentives become the language of rationalizing all types of behaviors, and those fluent in it will lie their way to the top.

I've made justifications of my self serving behaviors. in Barcelona. They should build a better fence, have a different policy. 

Ultimately though I know better. People have called me out on it; my guilt and shame erupt and I'm in tears. 

I think people committing atrocities know better too.

>> Why someone does something is very different than excusing or justifying them for doing it. A "bad guys frame" prevents you from asking the right questions. Why are these young men, what causes young men to commit these acts of terrorism?

Responsibility in social psychology. We can't operate individually or as a society without a notion of free will. In what ways are people able to respond?
