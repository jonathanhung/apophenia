## **Plants**
Plants require Six hours direct sunlight, cuz we take energy away from fruit
Perfect: late afternoon sun 
Garden on south side of large structure. North side shaded during winter
October 10th shortest date or solstice
Younger plants need less but more frequent water. Water newly sown seeds 1-2/day everyday. Versus established plants need a couple times a week but thoroughly. 
Put plants to bed dry

## **Soil**
- Soil - sand and rocks. 
- Plot at St David's community garden is built on an Old brick factory
	- Soil is built on top of limestone, it becomes alkaline like central Texas water 
- Amending requires 2-4 inches every season
- Method for understanding whether it's been watered enough: grabbing a ball needs to be moist like a rung out sponge. 
- Sandy rocky plots need watering a lot, a lot of organic matter, amending the soil and keeping it adequate for plant growth.
- Water needs to penetrate six inches, can check back on it. 

## Amendments 
Amendments consist of compost and fertilizers
- to amend soil, recommends: 2/3 compost and 1/3 soil
- Fertilizer is usually made of animal products
	- 2/3/1 (essential nutrients)
	- Seaweed and fish into the soil or sprayed
	- Few weeks before you sow, can use around it
	- Don't fertilize directly into the plant till first true leaf

## **Mulching**
Mulching to maintain soil health, it abates weeds and retains soil moisture

## **Dealing with Bermuda Grass**
- Bermuda grass rhizome: long hook claw or spade. 
- Vinegar ? Maybe. 
- Maintain a strict perimeter and using a fabric...
- Cardboard and mulch works okay 

## Solarization
Solarization takes six to eight weeks

## No Dig Gardening
- Use cardboard based sheet-mulch on-top of weeds, sealing out the light
- Benefits: leave what's there, no need to root it out. 
- requires 6-8 inches of topsoil though on top
	- The drawbacks is you aren’t using the existing soil, just layering on top of it. So we’ll be piling on top quite a bit in order to get sufficient root depth. 
	- The cardboard has to be constantly soaked once we get the beds laid down and planted (so that the roots of our plants can pierce through eventually).
