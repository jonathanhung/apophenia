**Over-arching Mindsets**
- **Paternalistic**: takes responsibility for making choices on behalf of others
- **Empirical:** values scientific method and measurable outcomes
- **Humility**: because I am also human I also have biases
- **External Agency:** scope is limited to environmental affordances and adapting contexts with disregard for subjective phenomena such as beliefs, relational quality and culture
- **Universalist Epistemics**: cultural differences less important than what can be said generally of human behavior
- **Rationalist Ethics**: the definition of happiness, health and wealth stem from an Enlightenment model of the universe
- **Specific:** seeks to change specific behaviors
- **Individualist:** Focuses on improved individual outcomes and choice making

**Worldview**
- The world is complex and the individual has limited capability to make effective choices.
- Because we make choices as individuals within systems, we adapt systems to create improved individual outcomes. 
- More knowledge about the world has limited use to individuals, better to be deployed into the environment.
- People make bad choices influenced by biases and errors in calculating pay-offs.
- People are influenced by incentives (drawn to benefits).

**Design Posture**
- Designers are separated from users, acting as a conduit between lay-people and experts
- Designers distill complexity into succinct choices for users
- A designer's job is to embed expertise about human decision-making into the interface, policy or intervention

**Epistemic Posture**
- Respect knowledgable institutions: knowledge exists in academic papers and expert bodies
- Behavior is best studied in aggregate to form general patterns
- Knowledge is most effective when it's embedded in the interface, organization, or policy
- Internal phenomena are not as important as measured behaviors

**Theory of Change**
- Make the right thing to do the easy thing to do
- Change is impeded by barriers, incentives, and intention-action gaps
- Positive outcomes are defined by measured behaviors
- Avoid moral capture by only providing these tools to values-aligned companies
