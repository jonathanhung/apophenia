Sensing some clarity through a fog of concepts

## Post-Healing Communities as a thesis
Caveat: Tucker suppresses some laughter as he's humored by the fact that I'm responding to a two-year old perspective, and wonder if he still thinks the same way about things.
• What Tucker is/was responding to in this thesis was the over-emphasis (as he sees it) on healing within the intentional community ecosystem. 
• Instead he wanted a different place where instead of healing being foregrounded, he calls for a new space where we could share "our souls true expression" with the world

## Problematizing Healing as a Pre-requisite to creation
Previously I felt a bit put off by the concept of "arriving" at a healed state. The language that I most connect with is those who say "we are already worthy of love" regardless if we are not fully healed. Are we ever really "ready" to create, if we must wait for purification? 
• I brought up the critiques of buddhism by some, that it is an inert practice if we are always sweeping the template gate. 
• I also brought up the great Emerald pod that spoke to ritual initiation. 

**Is there a sequence of healing first, then post-healing creation?**
Tucker is deeply inspired by Bill Plotkin's work on initiation, ensoulment, and the rites of passage. There is a stage model and a sequence one undergoes in order to bring forward the gifts of the soul; a pattern language (which I won't enumerate here because I'm not familiar enough with the source material)

## Soul's True Expression
For the last 6-18 months, perhaps longer, I have lived with the question of whether there's something I lack: a true purpose. I've been living with this idea that I need my soul's calling, to go on a healing and soul journey. To arrive at the "knowing" of what it is mine to create (and I mean specifically a materialistic emphasis: purpose always feels like outcomes, measured, goals, etc). 

**On material creations**
Tucker first double-clicked on the idea of creations of the soul. He shared the perspective that we are always creating something, in that we are always putting something out into the world. Words, silence, trash, energy, violence, love, as well as concrete political, economic or tangible products. 

**On being perfect expression of God but also seeking more**
He also shared a multi-perspectival approach: that one can both be a perfectly unique expression of God, and simultaneously feel that there's something more we are being called to do. I can both be complete and also engaging in the mystery of what's next. 

**On the individualistic western exemplars of purpose**
Who's living their soul purpose? Examples were brought up -- Barack Obama, Tony Robbins -- which is where I launched into some critique. 
I felt that the idea of purpose is a western conception, that the hero's journey as a highly Individuated one. The myths are protagonist focused, on the creation of the great men of history, they always seem highly individuated and global (like Musk or Bezos) or something. 
Tucker acknowledged that there are ways in which the soul journey could result in someone becoming a better mother. 
But I must admit a bit unclear if this template has been badly mangled. 

**The lack of purpose might be a lack of community**
Is it possible that my feeling of lack of soul purpose is a result of the highly individuated and atomized culture we live in as moderns? Maslows hierarchy has an indigenous critique in that self-actualization (purpose) was always given as a function of being embedded in place and community. 
Tucker cites the pre-trans fallacy, in that we cannot go *back* to a culture where developmentally we maintain that consistent community context. Some people transcend that localized context, have to go on a journey, learn something and bring it back (or forward) to work its magic and gift within the community context. 

**What counts as a journey?**
Tucker brings up that Snow Raven's indigenous shamans have 12 stages of initiation into becoming a shaman including their version of "going to hell". Don't get me wrong, I feel as if I have suffered, in the last 12 months. But am I there? I don't know...

**De-bunking arrival**
My other issue with the idea of "purpose" is that when I feel it lacking, I always assume it's some constant, a point to arrive at. A value proposition statement, clear as day (or perhaps an essay that gets written as Tucker has done). 
Tucker explains that he is constantly engaging with the mystery of life. And that presently there is an open question about the future of his project, and while he would like to know the answer, he is going through a death process.

Every day is engaging with the mystery of the soul.
