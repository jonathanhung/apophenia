Buy carbon credits for a flight that you're on while in the plane. You would receive a graph when the transaction was complete or a certificate. Can it be done through Apple?

Can you sub question around notifications and services and the timing of experiences. Analogies include tipping for a Lyft while still on the ride. The traditional wisdom for donations was to wait till check out but perhaps it's better stacked with the experience itself
