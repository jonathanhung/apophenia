What's the one thing you would say, when it comes to design? 
Was asked that question last night. I don't think I have one thing but here's ten.

Bell curves - design for middle, design for edges
Content and data
Accessibility
Fidelity: match level of fidelity to the type of assumptions you wish to de-risk
Xs and Ys - panning a screen
Systems and patterns 
Human cognition
One thing at a time

Strategy stuff: 
Do the business discovery: what matters?
Mind your Constraints
Be mindful of contexts
Listen more (nimble)

Oh yeah and probably the best advice for last: pay a designer.
