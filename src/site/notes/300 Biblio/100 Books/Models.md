- making yourself vulnerable doesn’t just mean being willing to share your fears or insecurities. It can mean putting yourself in a position where you can be rejected, saying a joke that may not be funny, asserting an opinion that may offend others, introducing yourself to a group of people you don’t know, telling a woman that you like her and want to date her. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=621))
- “Screw the repercussions; this is who I am, and I refuse to be anyone else.” ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=626))
- Chances are, if you’re reading this and are bad with women, then you’re bad with women because you don’t express your true feelings and intentions very well. Perhaps you’re afraid to introduce yourself to women you find attractive or to ask them out on a date. Perhaps you consistently fall into boring conversation topics because they’re “safe” and shallow and you don’t have to risk offending or inciting anyone with them. Perhaps you don’t assert yourself and your ([Location 656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=656))
- Show your rough edges. Stop trying to be perfect. Expose yourself and share yourself without inhibition. Take the rejections and lumps and move on because you’re a bigger and stronger man. And when you find a woman who loves who you are (and you will), revel in her affection. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=675))
- But I’ll say this: if you consistently find it difficult to keep a woman interested in conversation; if you suffer from large amounts of anxiety around women; if you constantly feel a need to prove something to others or yourself, then there’s something there. Trust me, there’s something there. And there’s something you’re not expressing or some emotion you’re not in touch with. And that’s fine. We all go through it. Ultimately, what women want — what we all really want — is a strong, independent, non-needy partner who fulfills us, who we can share ourselves with and receive them in return. ([Location 766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=766))
- Men avoid demonstrating an honest interest in a woman because they believe it will signify that they are too invested in her — i.e., it will show that they are needy. They think that when you say, “You’re cute and I wanted to meet you,” that translates roughly to, “Hi, I’m such a desperate loser that I’m just going to throw all of my desires out there right now and beg you to accept them.” ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=850))
- I will give compliments only when I am honestly inspired to give them, and usually after already meeting a woman and displaying to her that I’m willing to disagree with her, willing to be rejected by her and willing to walk away from her if it ever comes to that. This willingness to walk away from her and this ability to accept nothing in return is what gives my genuine interest so much value. ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=941))
- I should add that these aren’t all-or-nothing propositions either. Look, we all want people to like us, and we all like to impress others. We all need some validation sometimes. We all do these things to certain degrees. It’s impossible to be perfectly non-needy all the time. But neediness is relative. That’s why I say it’s about being less invested in others’ perceptions instead of NOT invested in others’ perceptions. It’s an important difference. ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=966))
- Non-neediness means you respect yourself AND others. Narcissism means you only respect yourself. Neediness means you only respect others. ([Location 991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=991))
- Now, when I meet a woman at a place like that who doesn’t show me any depth to her personality, I’m unwilling to put any more effort into getting to know her. My boundary is established: I value curiosity, education, intelligence and authenticity. ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1048))
- Ultimately, your values determine your behavior. And that’s kind of the point of all of this: YOUR values determine your behavior, not what you think she wants, not what you think others want, but what is best for you and best for the relationship. ([Location 1134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1134))
- Our job is not to attract every woman, but to screen for women with a high potential of being attracted to who we really are. ([Location 1163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1163))
- The reality of incompatibility defines our entire strategy of dating women. To base our strategy on anything else is inefficient at best and downright damaging at worst. The world is what it is, it’s our job to simply present ourselves as boldly and clearly to it as possible, accept the reactions and move on the opportunities. ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1164))
- The goals of this strategy are efficacy and practicality. This is a strategy based on reality, not based on some sort of mythology about unlocking the secrets of every woman, or lofty promises to be able to sleep with every single hot girl you ever meet. ([Location 1176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1176))
- Ask yourself this: why would you want to be intimate with someone who doesn't appreciate you? Why would you ever settle for such a person? Because she's hot? Come on, have a little more self-respect. Have some higher standards. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1188))
- neutral. They will not necessarily turn down your offers, but they won’t offer or reciprocate themselves. The jury’s still out. They’ll often tentatively say yes, although they won’t seem overly enthusiastic about it. They’re still testing the waters. Or sometimes, they just haven’t considered you in that way yet. ([Location 1228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1228))
- As we mentioned earlier, women who are Neutral and who stay Neutral tend to eventually end up Unreceptive. You do this by expressing your vulnerability and your identity to them freely. When you express your truth to women, you will polarize them — they will either become Receptive to you or they will make themselves Unreceptive. ([Location 1354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1354))
- If you express your truth and demonstrate not only that you’re non-needy but also frictionless for her (similar interests, values, life situation, etc.), then she will become very Receptive. ([Location 1359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1359))
- This is the plight of the highly needy “Nice Guy.” He’s afraid of eliciting an emotional response in anybody, especially women (and especially himself); therefore, he’ll play it safe and elicit Neutral reactions from woman after woman. ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1365))
- As you can see, Neutral women are where so-called “game” comes into play. Having good game means you can take a woman who is Neutral and incite her to become Receptive to you quickly. You do this by making yourself vulnerable, sharing yourself unabashedly, and polarizing her one way or the other and being comfortable with either result. ([Location 1372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1372))
- The percentage of women who are Receptive to you will increase proportionally to the quality of your lifestyle, your social status, and your looks. The percentage of women that you’re able to move from Neutral to Receptive will be proportional to how good your “game” is, or how well you’re able to communicate and express yourself with women. And your ability to sort through each type of women and meet as many as possible will be determined by how fearless and bold you are when it comes to meeting women. ([Location 1397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1397))
- You have to be controversial. You have to polarize. ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1412))
- Like I mentioned earlier, the most common strategy by men who are inexperienced with women is “to be liked by all, hated by none.” But when it comes to being intimate and attracting women, this is a horrible strategy. Being hated by nobody usually means you’re not loved by anybody either. The men who employ this strategy employ it because they’re trying to avoid confrontation and controversy. Many of these men have been avoiding confrontation and controversy their entire lives. It’s part of their fear of vulnerability. The fact is that sexuality, attraction, and relationships are, by their very nature, confrontational and controversial. ([Location 1420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1420))
- The reason men fear rejection is because they’re operating on other peoples’ truths, not their own. ([Location 1502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1502))
- When you get out there and start meeting a lot of women, you’ll begin to notice that there’s a lot to be said about “the right person at the wrong time.” ([Location 1509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1509))
- This is why we pursue women based on our truth. This is why we polarize women as soon as possible. This is why we approach women looking to see if she fits our values and needs and not the other way around. ([Location 1517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1517))
- Men put a lot of pressure on one another and shame one another for being rejected and this develops an unhealthy culture of masculinity based around neediness rather than genuine self-expression. ([Location 1537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1537))
- Choosing how we define success with women is vitally important. If you choose the wrong way to define success for yourself, then the months or years of effort you put into achieving that goal will go to waste. ([Location 1538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1538))
- When we define success as finding the relationship(s) that will maximize our happiness, our approach takes a completely new light. ([Location 1559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1559))
- There are three ways in which we are honest. And those three ways will make up the bulk of this book. The three ways are 1) living based on our values (lifestyle); 2) becoming comfortable with our intentions (boldness); and 3) by expressing our sexuality freely (communication). The first way of expressing our truth involves developing a lifestyle that makes us happy. The second way of expressing truth is by being courageous and fighting through our fears and anxieties. And the third way of expressing truth is by communicating well and being uninhibited in our sexuality. ([Location 1576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1576))

- For instance, Honest Living, or creating an attractive lifestyle involves really drilling down and understanding what you want as a man for your life and then working to make that a reality. If you’re in a job you hate with hobbies you hate and friends you don’t like, then no matter what you do or how much money you make, you’re going to have a hard time meeting attractive women that you enjoy and who enjoy being with you. This is because the identity you have adopted does not accurately reflect your emotional needs and desires. You are not living your life honestly, which means you are not investing in yourself, which means you are needy and unattractive. ([Location 1599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1599))
- Because you’re living 40 hours a week, every week, investing your identity in what others want out of you and not what you want of yourself. ([Location 1609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1609))
- Chances are, you’re already pretty strong in one or more of the Three Fundamentals and weak or mediocre at one or more of them. ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1640))
- When I’m in a random bar in Texas, I rarely meet women who have traveled. But when I go to a European wine tasting in New York, I almost meet nothing but women who love to travel. ([Location 1786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1786))
- When I’m in the US, I spend my time at venues or events that are likely to have foreigners. Whenever I’m in the US and I meet a woman from say, Argentina, and I immediately start telling her about the three months I lived in Buenos Aires — in Spanish — it’s pretty easy to get a date with her, as you can imagine. ([Location 1836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1836))
- Take up cooking classes, food tastings, restaurant openings, etc. ([Location 1845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1845))
- What’s not quite as obvious but just as important, if not more important, is how our beliefs naturally screen the women who come into our lives. When I say beliefs, I mean beliefs about women, sex, relationships, and ourselves. ([Location 1849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1849))
- The assortment effect through personal beliefs is incredibly powerful. I think that most “problems” men try to overcome with tactics and techniques could easily be solved by simply questioning our beliefs. ([Location 1865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1865))
- Unfortunately, questioning and re-evaluating our beliefs about women and relationships is far harder and more uncomfortable than simply memorizing a pick up line or two. ([Location 1871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1871))
- Demographics, and more importantly, analyzing our beliefs about relationships before we even start pursuing one, allows us to avoid these problems before they even happen, to avoid the disastrous breakups before they can ever occur. ([Location 1896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1896))
- women are looks and money highly important? Women who tend to only value good looks tend to be women who only have good looks and little else to offer. Women who are highly interested in money are going to be women who don’t have other interests or opportunities in front of them. ([Location 1926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1926))

- It’s all relative. The key is to 1) recognize your personal interests and strengths, and 2) build upon those personal interests and strengths to quickly attract women in your preferred demographic. ([Location 1956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1956))
- The goal, as a man, is to cultivate as much social proof within your demographic as possible. ([Location 1969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1969))
    - topic:: [[favorite\|favorite]] 
- That’s why once you’ve narrowed down your demographic, you want to cultivate your connections and put yourself into as big of a leadership position as possible. ([Location 1974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1974))
- Part of living the honest lifestyle is to pursue what you’re passionate about to the fullest extent. If you absolutely love visiting art exhibitions, don’t just visit a bunch of art exhibitions, but take an active role in the organization, start a meet up group to find other people who want to visit them, or create a forum for commentary. ([Location 1977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=1977))
- This is why trying to impress women by flaunting an image of what you think is attractive will always backfire. Men can go out and perform as much as they want — for weeks, months, or even years — and they’ll never get good results because they’re not portraying themselves well. They don’t have a clear and successful identity. They aren’t in touch with the way in which they’re living their lives. ([Location 2009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2009))
- Another problem men have is they often talk too quickly. This comes from a subconscious belief that if we don’t get everything out quickly, people won’t listen to everything we have to say. This is a needy behavior. ([Location 2180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2180))
- Attractive men are polarizing and uninhibited. Attractive men make their opinions known. They’ve had unique experiences and ideas. They’ve tried things many people haven’t tried, done things many people haven’t done, and share their ideas openly and freely. ([Location 2196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2196))

- Find a happy group of friends. Find a few hobbies that you love. Develop opinions. Start caring about what you spend your time doing. This increases your self-investment and will make you less needy around others. This, in turn, will give you the courage to take the correct action and the wherewithal to communicate effectively. This is honest living. ([Location 2278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2278))

- I’m not going to lie and say that despite all of my hedging and indifference that I magically came up with some miraculous line that saved the day. Because I didn’t talk to her. In fact, I don’t remember seeing her again or thinking of her until I wrote this. So I didn’t save the day. But then again there was nothing wrong with my day and there still isn’t. I’m also not going to sit here, as is typical with these types of books, and chastise myself for bitching out, for being a pussy, and for not manning up. ([Location 2299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2299))
- Let’s be honest, we all pass up dozens of situations like the above on a weekly basis, no matter how experienced or inexperienced we are. We’ve all let hundreds, if not thousands of opportunities go, usually without a thought or even realizing it. We’ve all done it. And we’ll all continue to do it. So I’m not here to rail on you to stop passing up opportunities. You already know the opportunities you pass up. And I’m sure by now you’ve had more than your fill of woulda-coulda-shoulda moments. ([Location 2307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2307))
- a continuing internal resistance to change, whether it be through outright fear, or subtle subconscious thoughts trying to sabotage me. ([Location 2319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2319))
- And from what I’ve observed, everybody’s subconscious defense mechanisms are still kicking. The resistance doesn’t go away. It just changes shape. Over the years, anxiety morphs into apathy, which morphs into arrogance. ([Location 2325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2325))
- What stories do you tell yourself? Because until you’re aware of your stories, you’re not going to be able to change your behavior. ([Location 2347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2347))
- The only important "skill" in dating is learning how to stop buying into your own bullshit, to stop believing your own stories. ([Location 2364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2364))
- Anxiety, almost by its very definition, represents a high level of neediness. Let’s say a beautiful woman sits down next to you and you want to say something to her but are scared to death. The fact that you’re scared to death demonstrates a high level of investment in her opinion of you, and thus a high degree of neediness. ([Location 2389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2389))

- For instance, let’s say you’re anxious about giving a presentation at work. Someone who does the Blame Game will come up with reasons why his boss is stupid and how he’s way too smart to be doing this anyway and how it’s not his fault if things go wrong because he’s been sick and so-and-so didn’t do enough research. ([Location 2403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2403))
- Men who have played the blame game their whole lives may develop screwed up beliefs like, “All women care about is how much money a guy has,” or “All girls in bars are stupid and shallow.” This can lead to some pretty dark places. ([Location 2410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2410))
- But there are many men who use intellectualizing as just another form of avoidance. It tends to be really smart guys too, which is a problem, because the smarter you are, the more you’re able to intellectualize and convince yourself that you need to learn and understand more. ([Location 2425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2425))
- Sharing your fears and having someone keep you accountable is integral to this whole process and makes it 10 times easier. Even the very act of sharing your fear with someone who can empathize and understand goes a long way towards relieving the pressure. ([Location 2458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2458))
- Blame is yet another form of neediness. It’s prioritizing others over yourself. As long as it’s their fault, then you don’t have to make yourself vulnerable. ([Location 2489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2489))
- But when you practice taking responsibility for everything that happens in your life, you stop blaming others. ([Location 2491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2491))
- Think about it. Why do women spend so much time and effort on their appearance? Why do they go to singles’ bars and join dating sites and give blind dates a try? They don’t do it so that they can revel in rejecting a bunch of guys. They’re just as lonely and frustrated as we are. They want to meet a man. But not just any man, a great man — a man who is confident, charming, fun, and interesting. A man who is non-needy, who is vulnerable, and who will honestly express himself to her. ([Location 2583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2583))
- The classic advice when it comes to taking action is more or less to jump into the deep end until you learn to swim. ([Location 2616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2616))
- In Buddhism, there’s a saying, “What you resist will persist.” And it’s true in this case as well. The proper way to handle your fear and your anxiety is to accept it, recognize that it’s normal and a part of who you are, and to not even try to hide it from the woman you’re meeting. ([Location 2643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2643))

- There’s momentum to it, which is absolutely integral to developing a healthy and successful love life. ([Location 2715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2715))
- So as a wise friend of mine sometimes says, “Give yourself permission to be creepy.” Don’t try to be creepy. And definitely don’t walk around looking to intimidate women. Simply accept that sometimes, miscommunications happen, awkward situations occur, and things get misconstrued. Such is life. As long as you’re respectful in how you express yourself, there should never be a serious problem. ([Location 2830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=2830))
- attractive social behaviors are rooted in a comfort with making yourself vulnerable, an honest expression of your desires, and ultimately, embodying non-neediness and investing in yourself. ([Location 3028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005EOTH24&location=3028))
