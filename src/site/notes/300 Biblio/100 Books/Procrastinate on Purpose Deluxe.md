## Highlights

- You and I have the same amount of time in a day as Gandhi, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa, Michael Jordan or anyone else who has achieved greatness. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=225))
- Striving for “work–life balance” is an impractical standard; it’s one that won’t bring you the results you truly seek—and it should be avoided. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=234))
- Success usually is the result of focusing our talents, money, time or energy in one priority direction for a shorter period of time to create a desired result, which in Take the Stairs I called a “season.” ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=239))
- The beauty of imbalancing your resources in one direction for a short period of time is that once you create your desired result, it is usually much easier to maintain that level of performance postseason. It becomes comfortable to consistently stay in the new range and usually requires much less effort and/or little thinking at all. A panoramic view of a season and postseason leads us instead to the strategy that we like to call “working double-time part-time for full-time free time.” ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=248))
- Embrace the season. Embrace the focused imbalance. Embrace working double-time part-time and you shall soon embrace the full-time free time. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=263))
- it forced me to elevate my organization and processes by which I manage projects at work to levels that I likely would’ve never reached without those pressures. This constant struggle has strengthened my ability to clearly and quickly evaluate—at any given moment in my personal or my professional life—‘what is the next thing I can do that is going to truly make a critical difference?’” ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=436))
- “The key is not to prioritize what’s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.”* ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=462))
- The primary appeal that Dr. Covey was making was that results come by focusing on quadrant 2 (Important but Not Urgent). These are things like planning your strategy, relationship building, and recognizing and investing in new opportunities. The challenge for most of us, though, is that we would give up these quadrant 2 activities by accidentally allowing ourselves to be sucked into the quadrant 1 (Important and Urgent) activities. ([Location 470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=470))
- Family Faculty (Work) Faith Fitness Fun Finances ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=491))
- We don’t have peace; we have frustration. We don’t have completion; we have piles. We don’t have results; we have tasks. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=532))
- So when we prioritize, we aren’t creating more time; we are borrowing time. We are borrowing time from one area of our life to give to another. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=563))
- The world we live in today throws so much information at us, and we can be processing so many things at once, that our priorities can literally align and then realign based on the new information in a matter of seconds. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=575))
- If Urgency is “how soon does this matter?” And Importance is “how much does this matter?” Then Significance is “how long is this going to matter?” ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=602))
- Those making the Significance calculation are operating on a plane of different perspective. They are considering not only what matters now but also what matters later. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=628))
- You multiply your time by spending time on things today that will give you more time tomorrow. ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=651))
- I realize that there are certain investments of my time that may cost me time today—sacrificing my ability to satisfy some of the Urgent temporarily—but that these investments of my time will have a positive effect on my day tomorrow by creating more margin in my life. There are things I can do today that will make tomorrow better. There are choices that I can make now that will create more space later. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=661))
- should be doing anything that is going to make tomorrow easier. And I also immediately start to know what I should stop doing! I should stop thinking about only today. ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=668))
- And—at least for me—I couldn’t just ask, ‘What do I want to accomplish with my life?’ but rather, I had to define success in a more significant way. Finally, I asked myself the question, ‘What does God want me to accomplish with my life?’ and everything changed. ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=711))
- “With the backdrop of my definition of success—pointing as many people as possible toward the hope of Christ—I would be a failure if I spent forty hours per week doing all individual counseling sessions. This process created a rhythm for my life and my time that was workable ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=721))
- The scheduling process that Pete stumbled upon is very common among Multipliers and is something that we at Southwestern Consulting refer to as creating a “categorical schedule.” It allows you to feel more in control by blocking a certain amount of time each day or week for types of activities without locking yourself into hard specifics of what might feel “rigid” and “constricting,” as with traditional schedules. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=724))
- Choosing how to spend your time isn’t just logical; it’s emotional. Human beings are not logical creatures. We are emotional. As human beings, we are driven by feeling and we are moved by impulses. We have a desire to please. We have a yearning to impress. We have a need to be accepted. We are tempted by pleasure. We get tired from work. We get stressed from pressure. And we are called to experience community and connectedness. Oh yes. We are definitely emotional. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=750))
- And the real power here is that you are looking for things that you can just stop doing. No explanation. No warning. No ramp-down time. No apology. What are the things that we can just stop? Once you try on a Multiplier’s perspective and you start thinking about where you have a chance to Eliminate, you might realize that sometimes we engage in completing trivial tasks just to satisfy our need to feel accomplishment. Those are the first sets of activities that we can get rid of. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=817))
- As a Multiplier, you are focused on results, not tasks. Success is no longer related to the volume of tasks you complete but rather the Significance of them. As Peter Drucker once said, “There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.” ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=822))
- “We’ve found that if you develop the practice of ‘precisely codifying and effectively communicating’ decisions made to the right people, that most weekly meetings can be turned into monthly meetings. If ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=855))
- every second wasted is one second that is stolen from serving a customer or making someone else’s life better. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=858))
- Let me clue you in on something that took me a long, painful time to learn. You are always saying no to something. Any time you say yes to one thing, you are simultaneously saying no to something else. You cannot say yes without also implicitly saying no. By saying yes to reading this book right now, you are quietly saying no to an infinite number of other things you could be doing. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=938))
- received my first rejection. It was not from the author personally but from a person in their office. The thing that shocked me was not only did they respond to me, but responded rather quickly and pleasantly. I received two paragraphs with useful information, a redirection to additional resources, and it included uplifting language such “Thank you so much for your e-mail, which I have shared with ______.” And “although meeting with you at this time will unfortunately not be an option, ______ truly appreciates you taking the time to write, and deeply wishes you all the best.” ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=948))
- This author has been rejecting me for seven years. Not to mention that it’s been via multiple media! And I love it. I’m more endeared to them than I ever have been before because of the way they are telling me no. They are telling me no with honesty. They are telling me no with integrity. They are telling me no with class. And they are clearly telling me no. They aren’t misleading me. They aren’t lying to me. They aren’t making me wrong. They aren’t getting mad or annoyed at me. And that makes me feel like they aren’t really rejecting me; they just don’t have time to meet. ([Location 994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=994))
- And if you are a big giant softie who is afraid of upsetting people, then make it the biggest, best-est, nicest, classiest no they’ve ever gotten! ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=1002))
- It’s fine to be nice and it’s good to be respectful, but for you to gain peace and perspective in your life, you have to learn to be okay with just Ignoring certain things. You need to free yourself of the need to feel like you have to be everything to everyone. You have to let go of the absurd idea that you owe everyone an explanation. You have to rewrite the story that you have to take on everything that comes your way. You have to learn to just flat out Ignore certain things. Delete it. Eliminate it. Eradicate it. Get rid of it. If the only reason you are doing something is because you feel guilty about not doing it—then don’t do it. ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=1014))
- The third group—the people most likely to be rich over time—would ask themselves two questions: “Do I want this five-dollar coffee?” Assuming the answer is yes, however, their second question is much different from the first two groups. Their next thought is, “If I spend five dollars on this coffee, then that is five dollars I will not be spending on something else.” That is five dollars they won’t be investing in the stock market, or real estate, or a business, or in themselves. Specifically, they realize that is five dollars they won’t be investing. ([Location 1062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=1062))
- their question is: “Is this five-dollar coffee worth fifty dollars to me thirty years from now?” ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=1069))
- Multipliers, who live in a world of evaluating everything based on Significance—how long this decision is going to matter—are constantly thinking longer term. ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=1102))
- Most of us either see good opportunities and don’t take action because we are unsure, or we invest into every new possible thing that comes our way. Both are losing strategies. One simple technique that has helped me navigate the appropriate dichotomy of those two dynamics to determine which investments make sense and which ones don’t is using something I call G.R.O.W. ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=1185))
- Frequently asked questions (FAQs): A simple idea that any small business or big business can do is to invest some time into an easy-to-use, easy-to-find, well-thought-out list of answers to FAQs. ([Location 1224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=1224))
- Automate applies to all of us: Any time you can set up a system whereby someone can reduce the amount of “think time” she has to spend to complete a regimented task, you will have created savings. ([Location 1258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=1258))
- And that’s when I finally realized that no matter how fast you work, no matter how smart you are, no matter how much passion you have . . . A company can never outgrow the strength of its systems. ([Location 1303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=1303))
- I am infinitely better off owning 10 percent of ten businesses that other people run, than owning 100 percent of things that I have to run.” ([Location 1567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=1567))
- the “last minute” here is really “the last minute that you can afford to wait until later and still get exactly what you wanted done without causing any damage.” ([Location 1743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=1743))
- “Whenever possible, I never take an action that can’t be untaken until either I have to or until there is an overwhelmingly compelling reason that I should.” ([Location 1776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=1776))
- Burn out.   Or . . . Something else will happen. They will realize that the thing driving them is not a real deadline; it’s an imaginary one. They will see that staying “ahead of schedule” is not what their true goal is; it’s a façade. They will understand that the very thing they’ve relied on is what they have to let go of. And if they are incredibly lucky, they will stop for a moment . . . And finally come to grips with where the pressure they feel is really coming from . . . Their own fear of not being good enough. And in that moment it will make sense to ([Location 1840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00OZ0TNU4&location=1840))
