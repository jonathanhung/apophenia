- And that, in essence, is the core difficulty of decision making: What’s in the spotlight will rarely be everything we need to make a good decision, but we won’t always remember to shift the light. ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=62))
- When the researchers compared whether process or analysis was more important in producing good decisions—those that increased revenues, profits, and market share—they found that “process mattered more than analysis—by a factor of six.” Often a good process led to better analysis—for instance, by ferreting out faulty logic. But the reverse was not true: “Superb analysis is useless unless the decision process gives it a fair hearing. ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=102))
- Cole is fighting the first villain of decision making, narrow framing, which is the tendency to define our choices too narrowly, to see them in binary terms. We ask, “Should I break up with my partner or not?” instead of “What are the ways I could make this relationship better?

- again. When people have the opportunity to collect information from the world, they are more likely to select information that supports their preexisting attitudes, beliefs, and actions. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=189))
- This brings us to the third villain of decision making: short-term emotion. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=250))
- Ben Franklin was aware of the effects of temporary emotion. His moral algebra wisely suggests that people add to their pros-and-cons list over several days, giving them a chance to add factors as they grow more or less excited about a particular idea. Still, though, to compare options rigorously is not the same as seeing the bigger picture. No doubt Andy Grove had been compiling his pros-and-cons list about whether to exit the memory business for many years. But the analysis left him paralyzed, and it took a quick dose of detachment—seeing things from the perspective of his successor—to break the paralysis.

- learn, the fourth villain of decision making is overconfidence. People think they know more than they do about how the future will unfold. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=274))
- We can’t deactivate our biases, but these people show us that we can counteract them with the right discipline. The nature of each villain suggests a strategy for defeating it:     1. You encounter a choice. But narrow framing makes you miss options. So … → Widen Your Options. How can you expand your set of choices? We’ll study the habits of people who are expert at uncovering new options, including a college-selection adviser, some executives whose businesses survived (and even thrived) during global recessions, and a boutique firm that has named some of the world’s top brands, including BlackBerry and Pentium.     2. You analyze your options. But the confirmation bias leads you to gather self-serving info. So … → Reality-Test Your Assumptions. How can you get outside your head and collect information that you can trust? We’ll learn how to ask craftier questions, how to turn a contentious meeting into a productive one in 30 seconds, and what kind of expert advice should make you suspicious.     3. You make a choice. But short-term emotion will often tempt you to make the wrong one. So … → Attain Distance Before Deciding. How can you overcome short-term emotion and conflicted feelings to make the best choice? We’ll ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=363))
- discover how to triumph over manipulative car salesmen, why losing $50 is more painful than gaining $50 is pleasurable, and what simple question often makes agonizing decisions perfectly easy.     4. Then you live with it. But you’ll often be overconfident about how the future will unfold. So … → Prepare to Be Wrong. How can we plan for an uncertain future so that we give our decisions the best chance to succeed? We’ll show you how one woman scored a raise by mentally simulating the negotiation in advance, how you can rein in your spouse’s crazy business idea, and why it can be smart to warn new employees about how lousy their jobs will be.

- Our goal in this book is to teach this four-step process for making better choices. Note the mnemonic WRAP, which captures the four verbs. We like the notion of a process that “wraps” around your usual way of making decisions, helping to protect you from some of the biases we’ve identified.

- made. In Van Halen’s world, a brown M&M was a tripwire. COULDN’T WE ALL USE a few tripwires in our lives? We’d have a “trigger weight” that signaled the need to exercise more, or a trigger date on the calendar that reminded us to ask whether we’re investing enough in our relationships. Sometimes the hardest part of making a good decision is knowing there’s one to be made. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=456))
- The question a college-bound senior should be asking, according to Price, is not “What’s the highest-ranking college I can convince to take me?” Rather, it should be “What do I want out of life, and what are the best options to get me there?” Those two questions are in no way synonymous, and once families start thinking about the latter one, they often find that they have many more good options than they ever thought possible.

- “The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants each serving a town of 60,000 people. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some 50 miles of concrete highway. We pay for a single fighter with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=710))
- Many executives are worried that exploring multiple options will take too long. It’s a reasonable fear, but the researcher Kathleen Eisenhardt has found that the opposite is true. In a study of top leadership teams in Silicon Valley, an environment that tends to place a premium on speed, she found that executives who weigh more options actually make faster decisions. ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=877))
- In his memoir White House Years, he discusses a classic bureaucratic trick that was played on President Richard Nixon, who was considering what policy to adopt on a particular issue in Europe. The State Department presented a memo to Nixon with three “options.” Kissinger noted that two options were obvious losers, leaving only one plausible choice: Here was the standard bureaucratic device of leaving the decision-maker with only one real option, which for easy identification is placed in the middle. The classic case, I joked, would be to confront the policymaker with the choices of nuclear war, present policy, or surrender.

- How you react to the position, in short, depends a great deal on your mindset at the time it’s offered. Psychologists have identified two contrasting mindsets that affect our motivation and our receptiveness to new opportunities: a “prevention focus,” which orients us toward avoiding negative outcomes, and a “promotion focus,” which orients us toward pursuing positive outcomes. ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=966))
- Other questions in the playlist include:     • Is there a key color for the brand?     • What is the enemy of this product?     • What would the brand be like if it was the market share leader?     • What if it was an upstart?     • Can you personify the product? ([Location 1195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=1195))
- What we’re seeing here is that, when you’re stuck, you can use a process of “laddering up” to get inspiration. The lower rungs on the ladder offer a view of situations very similar to yours; any visible solutions will offer a high probability of success, since the conditions are so similar. As you scale the ladder, you’ll see more and more options from other domains, but those options will require leaps of imagination. They’ll offer the promise of an unexpected breakthrough—but also a high probability of failure. When you start looking for cross-fertilization between the medical-plastics domain and the world of lingerie, you’re likely to find yourself at a lot of dead ends (or perhaps with a very hard and uncomfortable bra).

- To make good decisions, CEOs need the courage to seek out disagreement. Alfred Sloan, the longtime CEO and chairman of General Motors, once interrupted a committee meeting with a question: “Gentlemen, I take it we are all in complete agreement on the decision here?” All the committee members nodded. “Then,” Sloan said, “I propose we postpone further discussion of this matter until our next meeting to give ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what this decision is about. ([Location 1467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=1467))
- Almost certainly, you’d read more of the positive reviews. You really want this restaurant to be great. A recent meta-analysis of the psychology literature illustrated how dramatic this effect is. In reviewing more than 91 studies of over 8,000 participants, the researchers concluded that we are more than twice as likely to favor confirming information than disconfirming information. (So, scientifically speaking, you’d probably read twice as many four-star reviews as two-star reviews.) ([Location 1476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=1476))
- The most important lesson to learn about devil’s advocacy isn’t the need for a formal contrarian position; it’s the need to interpret criticism as a noble function. An effective promotor fidei is not a token argumentative smarty-pants; it’s someone who deeply respects the Catholic Church and is trying to defend the faith by surfacing contrary arguments in situations where skepticism is unlikely to surface naturally. ([Location 1507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=1507))
- What would have to be true for this option to be the right answer? ([Location 1542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=1542))
- The best question to ask, in hopes of discovering the truth, was this one: “What problems does it have?” That prompted 89% of the sellers to come clean. ([Location 1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=1613))
- An expert doesn’t have to be a heavily credentialed authority, though. The bar is actually far lower than that: An expert is simply someone who has more experience than you. If your son wants to be a carpenter, go talk to a carpenter. Any carpenter. If you’re thinking about relocating your business to South Carolina, call up someone, anyone, who has relocated their business to South Carolina. Here’s what is less intuitive: Be careful what you ask them. As we’ll see in the next chapter, experts are pretty bad at predictions. But they are great at assessing base rates. As an example, imagine that you are indeed consulting an IP lawyer about a potential patent-infringement suit. The right kinds of questions to ask him are “What are the important variables in a case like this?,” “What kind of evidence can tip the verdict one way or the other?,” “In percentage terms, how many cases get settled before trial?,” and “Of those that go to trial, what are the odds that the plaintiff prevails?” If you ask questions like that—questions about past cases and legal norms—you will get a wealth of trustworthy information. ([Location 1870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=1870))
- You should distrust the inside view—those glossy pictures in your head—and instead get out of your head and consult the base rates. ([Location 1886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=1886))
- Brian wanted more textured information, more color. He wanted to see, with his own eyes, what life was like for these patients. And that’s what we’ll see next: In assessing our options, the best complement to the big picture is often a close-up. ([Location 1996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=1996))
- Like all presidents, FDR was concerned about the quality of information that reached him, worried that it would be polluted by the agendas of the people passing it along. Hungry for trustworthy data, FDR became the first president to make heavy use of polling to keep tabs on public opinion. ([Location 2002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=2002))
- He was also aggressive about developing sources of “ground truth,” cultivating a network of sources outside the federal government, such as businessmen, academics, friends, and relatives. They served as his eyes and ears outside of the bureaucracy. “Go and see what’s happening,” he told one. “See the end product of what we are doing. Talk to people; get the wind in your nose. ([Location 2004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=2004))
- Much more than prior presidents, Roosevelt used the mail as a strategic source of information. In his fireside chats, he encouraged Americans to send him their views, and they responded: The White House averaged 5,000 to 8,000 pieces of mail per day. If the volume of mail dipped, he groused to his advisers about it. Roosevelt insisted that the mail be analyzed scientifically; he had it sorted by category and by stance, and these statistical breakdowns were delivered to him as “mail briefs.” These briefs provided ready-made base rates on the public’s point of view. FDR went a step further; he pushed beyond the base rates and reviewed a sample of the actual letters. What the letters added was texture. It’s one thing to know, in statistical terms, how people feel about an issue. But what’s their temperature? Are they concerned, or irritated, or angry, or violently incensed? The numbers can conceal the nuance. ([Location 2019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=2019))
- Another variety of close-up involves going to the genba, a Japanese term meaning “the real place” or, more loosely, the place where the action happens. Japanese detectives, for instance, call the crime scene the genba. In a manufacturing firm, the genba would be the factory floor, and for a retailing company it would be the store. Practitioners of Total Quality Management encourage leaders to “go to the genba” to understand problems. If a problem occurs on a factory floor, for example, engineers should go see it firsthand, assessing the situation and talking directly to the people involved. The best ideas, it’s believed, come from this kind of close-up sensory investigation of the situation; how can you improve something you don’t fully understand?

- There’s a tool we can use to accomplish this emotion sorting, one invented by Suzy Welch, a business writer for publications such as Bloomberg Businessweek and O magazine. It’s called 10/10/10, and Welch describes it in a book of the same name. To use 10/10/10, we think about our decisions on three different time frames: How will we feel about it 10 minutes from now? How about 10 months from now? How about 10 years from now? The three time frames provide ([Location 2496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=2496))
- Only in the most extreme cases are these values sufficient to tip a decision. Certainly no one at Interplast could have resolved the family-member debate by asking which option showed more “integrity.” ([Location 2875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=2875))
- Define and enshrine your core priorities. It is not exactly a radical stance. But there are two reasons why it’s uncommon to find people who have actually acted on this seemingly basic advice. ([Location 2914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=2914))
- The problem is that urgencies—the most vivid and immediate circumstances—will always hog our spotlight. ([Location 2927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=2927))
- So if you’ve made a resolution to spend more time with your kids, or to take a college class, or to exercise more, then part of that resolution must be to decide what you’re going to stop doing. ([Location 2939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009JU6UPG&location=2939))
- Drawing from those conversations, Captain Abrashoff sorted all the jobs performed on the Benfold into two lists: List A contained the mission-critical tasks, and List B contained the things that were important but not core, “the dreary, repetitive stuff, such as chipping and painting.” After compiling the two lists, Captain Abrashoff declared war on List B.

- To bookend the future means that we must sweep our spotlights from side to side, charting out the full territory of possibilities. Then we can stack the deck in our favor by preparing for both bad situations (via a premortem) and good (via a preparade).
