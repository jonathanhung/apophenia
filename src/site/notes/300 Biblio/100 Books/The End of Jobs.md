- “A few major opportunities, clearly recognizable as such, will usually come to one who continuously searches and waits, with a curious mind loving diagnosis involving multiple variables. And then all that is required is a willingness to bet heavily when the odds are extremely favorable, using resources available as a result of prudence and patience in the past.” ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010L8SYRG&location=643))
- Entrepreneurs are not different. Successful entrepreneurs have great relationships and valuable skillsets. If you have a deep knowledge of Search Engine Optimization and a large network of entrepreneurs who work in that industry, then you won’t have any trouble starting a business doing SEO. ([Location 1271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010L8SYRG&location=1271))
- You also need a different type of relationship: relationships with other entrepreneurs. Having relationships in your industry is important, but it’s equally important to have relationships with other people working in the same framework that you are. They let you see new business models, uncover new opportunities, and support you as you support them. ([Location 1277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010L8SYRG&location=1277))
- One common mistake early entrepreneurs make is that they think they need a business idea. That’s rarely the case: you don’t need a business idea—you need relationships ([Location 1396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010L8SYRG&location=1396))
- the Tom Sawyer Effect. It illustrates a simple lesson: As humans, we love to work but dislike the obligation of it—the job-based paradigm. ([Location 1624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010L8SYRG&location=1624))
- Because of the structural economic changes discussed earlier, meaning and freedom aren’t just luxuries to be put off later in life after you’ve “put in your time.” ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010L8SYRG&location=1645))
- Freedom and meaning aren’t something to be put off until after you’re rich—they help you get rich. ([Location 1650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010L8SYRG&location=1650))
- The average middle class worker in liberal democracies of the West today is freer in how and where they spend their best energy and time than John D. Rockefeller was one hundred years ago when he was among the ten richest men on Earth. The guy in his mid-30s that lives in the apartment next door is freer than John D., the industrial titan, was a century ago.

- In a world of vast possibilities, we focus all our attention on a relatively tiny portion because the most powerful people are structuring the consciousness of everyone else. ([Location 1959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010L8SYRG&location=1959))
- Instead of choosing from a set of available options, we can create our own. It’s the triumph of design over choice. Instead of ordering from the menu, we are more empowered than any prior generation to become the cooks. ([Location 1968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010L8SYRG&location=1968))
- “One of the reasons why I’m now without a position, why I’ve been without a position for years, it’s quite simply because I have different ideas from these gentlemen who give positions to individuals who think like them.” ([Location 2007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010L8SYRG&location=2007))
- Based on how we traditionally understand the role of incentives, we would expect that each group’s performance would increase as the monetary reward increased. For heuristic, complex tasks, the results of the experiment were precisely the opposite. Going from one day to two weeks’ pay in reward didn’t improve performance at all. Going from two weeks to five months’ decreased performance.58 As the pay increased, the group did worse at more complex tasks like unscrambling the anagram. Being purely incentivized by money reduced the quality of the work and made it less valuable. In another experiment where researchers looked at artists, they found that the work was actually worse when they were doing it as a job as opposed to something they chose to do. “Our results were quite startling. The commissioned (read: job-based) works were rated as significantly less creative than the non-commissioned (read: entrepreneurial) works, ([Location 2089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010L8SYRG&location=2089))
- We’re goal-seeking, striving creatures. We seek goals which create meaning and freedom in our lives. The lack of meaning is a modern problem. It’s solved by pursuing a goal greater than ourselves. In doing so, we actually produce more valuable work, are happier, and as a side effect, make more money. ([Location 2169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010L8SYRG&location=2169))
- But what if, instead of answering the email or reading those articles, you spent an hour every day working on that project you’ve been thinking about? Writing a book; launching a product on the side to begin stair stepping; looking for an apprenticeship with a company you admire; building a business that you could tell your grandchildren about. ([Location 2297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010L8SYRG&location=2297))
- Looking ninety days out, you have a good idea of what you can actually get done in that time frame. Your capacity estimations are about right, and yet you can make some very substantial progress towards a big goal. It leads to moving faster without compromising strategy. Having goals and visions for three to five years down the line is valuable in terms of knowing which direction you want to move, but it’s often not very helpful to try and plan out concrete steps—there’s just too much that has to get done, which feels overwhelming and leads to inaction. However, you probably have a pretty good idea of what opportunities are on your plate right now and how you can capitalize on them in the next ninety days. Maybe you know of a business you could approach about an apprenticeship. Or you have an idea for a small product to get you started. Or you know you want to learn copywriting. Once you launch those projects, new opportunities will pop up, and you can look at those in ninety days and reassess whether they’re heading in the right direction or not.
