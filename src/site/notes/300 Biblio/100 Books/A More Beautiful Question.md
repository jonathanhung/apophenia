- “If not now, then when? If not me, then who?”) ([Location 2529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=2529))
- Sharing a question with others is akin to issuing a challenge that a certain type of curious-minded person may find hard to resist. Just by formulating the question, you’ve taken a critical and difficult first step that others can now piggyback on. As the author Clay Shirky has75 noted in his writing, many people are drawn to an existing idea they can join in on and help to improve or advance, rather than starting from scratch on their own. ([Location 2584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=2584))
- How should my business respond to this new reality? How do we rewrite the old theories? Today, while market conditions and challenges have become even more complex, uncertain, and subject to radical disruption across industries, Christensen feels that business leaders, for the most part, still aren’t asking enough questions, and especially the right kinds of questions. ([Location 2670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=2670))
- It’s a sobering realization for many businesses: They can’t rest on what they’ve already done, or what they know. The need to bring a “beginner’s mind” to business may make it necessary to—if only temporarily—set aside all history, and all notions of what has worked in the past, in order to ask questions from a fresh perspective. ([Location 2812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=2812))
- If we were kicked out of the company, what do you think the new CEO would do? ([Location 2823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=2823))
- You could ask, as Grove and Moore did, What if different leaders were brought in?, but Clay Christensen suggests a bolder version of this question: What if the company didn’t exist? That question allows you to take a clean-slate approach in thinking about the industry and your place in it. ([Location 2829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=2829))
- The consultant Jack Bergstrand of Brand Velocity thinks14 one of the most important questions companies should ask regularly is What should we stop doing? ([Location 2839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=2839))
- Company leaders naturally tend to focus on what they should start doing. Bergstrand notes that coming to terms with what you’re willing to eliminate is always harder. Yet if you can’t answer that question, he maintains, “it lessens your chances of being successful at what you want to do next—because you’ll be sucking up resources doing what’s no longer needed and taking those resources away from what should be a top priority.” Moreover, if you can’t figure out what you should stop doing, it might be an early warning sign that you don’t know what your strategy is. ([Location 2842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=2842))
- That’s why some business leaders (including Steve Jobs when he headed Apple) have been known to use What If hypothetical questioning to temporarily remove practical constraints. One such approach is to encourage teams working on projects to ask themselves, What if money were no object? How might we approach the project differently? ([Location 2855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=2855))
- And they care more than ever about how companies are behaving, what a company’s values are, what that company stands for. ([Location 2885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=2885))
- As Peer Insight’s Tim Ogilvie observes, being true to a cause often requires making tough decisions and sacrificing at times. “When you come to the point where you can’t serve both the bottom line and the cause, one or the other must suffer,” says Ogilvie, pointing to the Whole Foods supermarket chain, which stopped selling live lobsters for an extended time until it found a supplier that did humane harvesting. “Those are hard choices, but when you opt for the cause over the bottom line, employees can see that, ([Location 2928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=2928))
- So, for example, if a company is introducing a new toothpaste, they might ask: How would IKEA tackle a challenge like this? Another approach is to add in an odd constraint, such as What if your idea had to involve speed dating? Rossi’s group sometimes suggests adopting the perspective of a well-known artist or entertainer: What would Jay-Z do in this situation? How would J. K. Rowling think about this? ([Location 3048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3048))
- to Sidney Parnes, a leading creativity expert at the time who headed up the Creative Problem Solving Institute in Buffalo, New York. Min Basadur studied at the CPSI during his tenure as a creative manager at Procter & Gamble in the early 1970s, and he adapted some of Parnes’ brainstorming ideas to help P&G’s marketers—who, ([Location 3063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3063))
- Randy Komisar, a leading Silicon Valley29 venture capitalist, says the best business leaders and entrepreneurs have a different attitude toward “answers.” “They understand that answers are relative. You can have an answer for right now, but it changes.” Because change is now a constant, the willingness to be comfortable with, and even to embrace, ambiguity is critical for today’s leaders. ([Location 3119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3119))
- To do this, she maintains, leaders must be able to get beyond their own assumptions, take in vast amounts of new information, and figure out how to apply all of that to their business, sometimes doing that via experimentation. This adds up to a lot of Why, What If, and How questions. ([Location 3141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3141))
- “One of the most important things to know about becoming more of a questioning leader is that the questions don’t all have to come from you,” says Patnaik. ([Location 3144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3144))
- “this feeling that if I listened hard to the deepest part of myself, there was a person in there who wanted to be adventurous. And I knew if I didn’t jump right then, I might never jump.” ([Location 3478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3478))
- Convincing investors to fund these high-risk, slow-yield ventures was only part of the challenge for Acumen. In many cases, the ambitious-but-inexperienced entrepreneurs receiving the funds needed guidance, expert advice, moral support—and sometimes a second round of funding—as they took their Why and What If questions through the difficult How stage of bringing these innovations to market. Novogratz observes that when you’re trying to do something that’s never before been done—and especially when you’re trying to do it in developing markets, where resources may be scarce and infrastructure lacking—the key is to learn and adapt as you go. ([Location 3507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3507))
- During a recent college commencement speech3 Novogratz gave in Pennsylvania, she focused a good part of her talk on urging the graduating students to embrace uncertainty and follow their own spirit of inquisitiveness. Quoting the famous line from the poet Rilke, she told the students to “live the questions.” ([Location 3521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3521))
- With that in mind, Novogratz was hoping her message might shift the thinking in some of the students—away from predetermined paths with designated next steps, to something a bit more open, unpredictable, and uncertain. “In a rapidly changing world, there really isn’t a step-by-step map for them anyway,” she said. “The best you can hope to have is a good compass to guide you. The ones who understand that—and can embrace that—are going to have the greatest adventures.” ([Location 3530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3530))
- Novogratz’s advice applies not just to graduating college students but to “track kids” of all ages—which is to say, everyone who’s following a path or climbing a ladder without necessarily knowing why; or those among us trying to do everything—attend every conference, take every call, answer every message, read every tweet, seize every opportunity—not so much because we want to, but because we feel we must, just to keep up. People have been feeling “swamped” for some time, but in the past year or two it seems to have reached a tipping point: ([Location 3536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3536))
- expressed concern that Kennedy might be in danger of trying to do too much, thereby losing focus. She told him “a great man is a sentence”—meaning that a leader with a clear and strong purpose could be summed up in a single line (e.g., “Abraham Lincoln preserved the union and freed the slaves”). Pink believes this concept can be useful to anyone, not just presidents. Your sentence might be, “He raised four kids who became happy, healthy adults,” or “She invented a device that made people’s lives easier.” If your sentence is a goal not yet achieved, then you also must ask: How might I live up to my own sentence? ([Location 3560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3560))
- The high school teacher David McCullough,9 son of the Pulitzer-winning historian, was reacting to the overachieving culture of his students when he gave a graduation speech (which later went viral on the Internet) in which he advised them, “Climb the mountain not to plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air, and behold the view. Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you.” ([Location 3572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3572))
- as Why am I climbing this mountain in the first place? If you take the time to ask that question—and give it the consideration it clearly deserves, given its significance—you might conclude, as Jacqueline Novogratz did, that you’re climbing the wrong mountain. Or you might find yourself asking other questions, such as:   What is waiting for me at the top?   What am I going to do once I get there?   Am I enjoying the climb itself? Should I slow down, speed up?   What am I leaving behind, down below? ([Location 3580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3580))
- For those concerned about not knowing what questions to ask, the work of the Right Question Institute (as well as Hal Gregersen’s question-storming exercises on page 154) shows that if you force yourself to sit with a problem or a topic and try to think of appropriate questions, you will almost certainly come up with many. The challenge, though, is not just to think of questions, but to then think about those questions—culling the best ones, improving them, and figuring out how you might begin to act on them. ([Location 3703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3703))
- But it all starts with slowing down, stepping back, and trying to shift perspective in order to see your own life—and the problems, opportunities, and challenges worth tackling—more clearly. ([Location 3710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3710))
- Finding the time and space to question, in a cultural landscape that doesn’t encourage it, is challenging. If questioning might be considered a form of slow thinking, we have to get away from the fast thinking that is required in everyday life—especially in the current fast-moving, info-overloaded environment. ([Location 3719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3719))
- the need to find one’s own “tortoise enclosure”—that19 sheltered, quiet place where you can go for extended periods to escape from the distractions of the outside world so that you can think without interruption. ([Location 3722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3722))
- Shlain said one of the benefits is that she is almost forced to grapple with her own questions instead of automatically going online to seek out answers. “On Saturday, when I’m stopped from doing that, I get to just sit with a question in a different way than I normally would,” ([Location 3737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3737))
- What are you doing when you feel most beautiful? In her travels for the Acumen Fund, she sometimes asks her question in unlikely settings: “I decided to try it out on women living in a slum in Bombay.” At first, it didn’t go over well: “One woman said, ‘There’s nothing in our lives that’s beautiful.’ But finally another woman, who worked as a gardener, said, ‘Well, I can think of one time. All winter long I slog and slog, but when those flowers push through the ground, I feel beautiful.’” ([Location 3830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3830))
- Novogratz maintains, “It’s important to think about that time and place and activity where you shine, where you feel most alive. I get all kinds of different answers—when I’m solving a problem, when I’m creating, when I’m connecting with someone, when I’m traveling.” ([Location 3834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GC53AG8&location=3834))
