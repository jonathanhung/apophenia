- Assessing motivational barriers can be the trickiest of the three components of COM-B. That’s because motivation, at least in the COM-B sense, contains a hodgepodge of factors that are hard to observe. And some of the items that fall under motivation may not be easy for people to tell you about if you ask them.
  For example, a lot of people might behave a certain way because of role identity: “This is how a father acts.” Unpacking that is a little like a therapy session that not everyone is able or willing to participate in.
  Many times, behavior change designers are left to infer what really falls into the motivational bucket based on what they can see and what they hear under the surface in talking to people ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggv8xbv7e97by3gpvvpa6fzs))

- What I find exciting is if you’re having people (for example) log every banking interaction in a spreadsheet, and then maybe write a sentence about it, they’re now more mindful of that behavior. This puts them in a state where they have the ability to reflect. People start to spontaneously tell me things like, “You know, since I’ve been collecting these things, I’ve noticed this . . . ” They seem to be more insightful.

- How do you help them build and maintain momentum over
  time?
  Because people thrive on progress, the path to a new behavior can be thorny. It’s littered with failed attempts and setbacks, as anyone who’s tried to make a significant change in their own behavior knows. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggt245t0hcsrsnrsambcspmw))
- That’s why effective behavior change design includes breaking hard goals down into more achievable pieces and making sure those pieces fit the person’s sweet spot in terms of difficulty and interest. Designers can add interest and emotion to the behavior change process to keep people invested in a long journey. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggt24knqc2qraxemavny4mn7))
- But people are optimists. They often imagine a better future self and commit to things that their new and improved alter ego will tackle with aplomb. Then the alter ego fails to materialize ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggv9895y3920qbtv0et4te26))
- Often, the future activities that people commit to require them to have accomplished something by the time the activities arrive (think physical challenges, intellectual or artistic projects, or achieving a certain physical appearance before a social event). If people haven’t thought through what that preparation entails, there’s a strong possibility they won’t be ready when the day comes. That can lead people to wrongly conclude they’re not capable, when in fact they just didn’t follow the right recipe to accomplish their goal. Unfortunately, these sorts of failures can dissuade people from future behavior change attempts ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggv99awec6a2carpxzj63q9y))
- Set the Right Goals
  The first step in designing for the future self is helping users select the right goals for themselves. These goals must have staying power if they’re to anchor new behaviors over a long period of time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggv9a8q5hcxvtaw3skpvvx7b))
- Bring the Target Closer
  The more distant a goal is, the more difficult it is for people to imagine it concretely. This means that accurate, realistic planning for how to reach a goal is much more difficult ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggv9dsrdgtm9gwkg77hjgmq7))
- Make a Plan to Reach Them
  Once users have picked a goal that’s appealing and enduring, it’s time to sketch out the path for achieving it. Most meaningful outcomes take lots of work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggv9e3kbyywf63s28mcy0k29))
- Set Expectations
  Recall from [Chapter 4](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/6932765#p110) that people who make informed decisions are more likely to stick with them when they get challenging. It’s time to be informative! You can help people calibrate their expectations around behavior change to be more realistic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggv9ed197vrdjjne1s7v0jy9))
- Shape the Environment
  Deciding to pursue a big future goal may be a single decision, but in practice it shakes out to hundreds or thousands of smaller decisions.
  The person undertaking behavior change may have to decide multiple times a day, week, or month to take actions that move them toward the goal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggv9fphwb5a5cq5z0q5hmvrg))
- You can reduce the need for this repetitive decision-making by structuring the environment to better support behavior change. This could mean removing prompts or cues for unwanted old habits, or facilitating new behaviors with reminders or tools. It could also mean equipping people with rules of thumb ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggv9g86sxnqm0bah3yyynr1j))
- Often, people opt out of behavior change because they value their comfort today more than the potential benefits of their efforts at a distant future time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggv9gx7rkk3hnnew972t0wpb))
- A lot of times traditional behavior change programs have this “all or nothing” approach. We haven’t really used technology to generate this in-between “Hey, let’s stay connected so that if the time comes that you need a little help, we’re still here. It’s not a failure. It’s actually so normal and so expected that we’d love to hang around and be here for you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggv9k9wmp2nkg760vq2bp2ar))
