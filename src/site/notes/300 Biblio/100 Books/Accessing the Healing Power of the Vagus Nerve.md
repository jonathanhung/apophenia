- All of the problems in this list occur at least partly from dorsal vagal activity or activation of the spinal sympathetic nervous system, and can be addressed by reinstating normal function of the ventral vagus nerve branch and other nerves required for social engagement ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy07pp909ddxazn1czbxch4t))

- Cranial Nerve Dysfunction and Social Engagement
  We consider “normal” human behavior to be an expression of positive social values. Our actions should be beneficial for our own survival and well-being, as well as for the well-being of others.
  When we are socially engaged, it is easy for other people to under-stand our behavior, and what we do makes sense to others; most of us are socially engaged most of the time. However, sometimes we temporarily drop into a state of chronic activation of the spinal sympathetic chain system (fight or flight) or of dorsal vagal activity (withdrawal, shutdown). Then, if our autonomic nervous system is resilient, we will soon bounce back up to a state of social engagement.
  Unfortunately, some of us are not socially engaged most of the time; if we lack the necessary resilience to spontaneously come back to a state of social engagement, we become stuck in sympathetic-chain or dorsal vagal states. In these states it is often hard for other people to understand our values, motivation, and behavior. Our actions seem irrational, often run counter to our own best interests, and can be destructive to ourselves and others ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy07w36x7708q14mabvq22z4))
- CN VII, the facial nerve, also has several motor functions. It controls the tensing and relaxing of the individual muscles of the face. Changes in the pattern of tensions in our facial muscles create our facial expressions, which not only communicate different emotions but also reflect our internal states in terms of health or illness. Ideally, changes in facial expressions are spontaneous and reflect the flow of changing emotions and thoughts.
  Is someone’s face deadpan, lacking animation? This is usually a sign of CN VII dysfunction. We can make faces voluntarily—for example, putting on a smile or opening our eyes wide. But these are not the same as spontaneous facial expressions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0xs1gyxgskf6js22gkda09))
- I generally ask all my clients if they have had a tooth extracted, or if they wore orthodontic braces. Either of these can cause chronic spinal sympathetic stimulation or a chronic dorsal vagal state. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0yeaemb4fcyxth4bar64jx))
- When one branch of a cranial nerve is under direct physical pressure, not only that branch but other branches of that nerve can become dysfunctional. Thus a dislocation between the sphenoid and palatine bones can result in dysfunction of the nerves to the face and middle ear; this is enough to block the entire social-engagement nervous system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0yemn5nvdjfnrzw7fawqx6))
- The tenth cranial nerve (the vagus)
  The tenth cranial nerve is a vital part of the autonomic nervous system. Before Stephen Porges presented the Polyvagal Theory, the vagus was assumed to function as a single neural pathway. However, we now know that the two branches of the vagus nerve—ventral and dorsal—arise at different places and have very different functions, and this book was written to elucidate those differences and their implications.
  An understanding of the two pathways of the vagus nerve provides treatment options for a wide variety of health conditions, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0yfc5mdx4t5tj1vv9sq9j9))
- However, if we want to manually improve or restore function in the cranial nerves, we need a different approach. Since 1920, there has been a form of treatment for addressing dysfunctions of the cranial nerves, called “cranial osteopathy,” “craniosacral therapy (CST),” or “osteopathy in the cranial field (OCF).”
  In the United States, doctors of osteopathy (DOs) have the same training as medical doctors. Like their MD counterparts, they are licensed to perform surgical operations, write prescriptions, and work in psychiatric hospitals. An important difference between osteopaths and MDs is that osteopaths have additional training in hands-on treatment techniques.
  William Garner Sutherland, DO (1873–1954) founded cranial osteop-athy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0yrt21vdt0j0fpp7p2m0rg))
- Magoun’s book describes three approaches to cranial work. One is biomechanical, in which the therapist holds two adjacent cranial bones for the purpose of mobilizing them in the sutures (where two or more skull bones come together). This can reduce mechanical pressure on the cranial nerves where they come through the various openings in the skull. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0z7pr72c9qn13qdv2wayzn))
- Another cranial treatment approach involves stretching the soft-tissue membranes within the skull and spine. The *dura mater* is a tube of connective tissue extending from the skull to the tailbone and containing the brain, spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid. The *falx cerebri* and the *tentorium* are connective-tissue sheets that hold the bones of the skull together and are collectively referred to as the “dural membranes.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0z7zdw23kqtjrkasgrft50))
- The third approach is called biodynamic craniosacral therapy. Its goal is maximizing movement of the cerebrospinal fluid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord, bringing nourishment to the tissues and help-ing to eliminate metabolic waste products.
  Biodynamic techniques facilitate release by using the flow of the cere-brospinal fluid contained within the dural membranes of the skull and spine. The therapist holds the client’s head with an extremely light touch, combined with a keen awareness of the tiny, subtle movements of the cranial bones.[9](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/46901641#c01-endnote-009) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0z8en0g5b2f3w041h6b2n2))
- We get a more accurate representation of the workings of the autonomic nervous system if we consider that the auto-nomic nervous system consists of three neural circuits: the ventral branch of the vagus nerve (positive states of relaxation and social engagement), the spinal sympathetic chain (fight or flight), and the dorsal branch of the vagus nerve (slowdown, shutdown, and depressive behavior). These three circuits regulate our bodily functions in order to help us maintain homeostasis. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy0zwearha4xvh8pfvdetnk5))
- Normal blood pressure is appropriate for muscles that are neither tense nor flaccid—muscles that feel just right. In states of social engage-ment, there is generally no threat or danger in our environment or body. Our nervous system registers this fact, so we do not have to do anything; we can truly relax and enjoy being with others. In terms of the Polyvagal Theory, we can be immobilized without fear, anger, or depressive activity when we are in a state of social engagement. Our blood pressure, blood sugar, and temperature are all normal. We can be still, yet awake and alert. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy10pvbza6spfd4vq1adkgcb))
- A handshake gives us a good indication of the state of another person’s autonomic nervous system. An overly tight body usually results from a chronic state of activity in the spinal sympathetic chain, where the entire muscular system is continually prepared to fight or flee. Such a person characteristically has an overly forceful handshake, squeezing harder than necessary. The opposite is true for someone lacking muscular tonus—usually a sign of overactivity in the dorsal vagal circuit. This person gen-erally has a limp, damp, and sometimes cold handshake.

- Biobehavior: the interaction of behavior and biological processes
  Unlike the old model of the autonomic nervous system, which focused exclusively on its regulation of the function of the visceral organs, the new model of the autonomic nervous system includes three distinct neu-ral pathways, as described above, and relates each of these three neural circuits with an emotional state, which drives our behavior. In addition to these three states, we have two hybrid states, each of which combines two of the individual circuits, for a total of five possible conditions of our autonomic nervous system.
  One hybrid state supports the experience of intimacy: the dorsal vagus is engaged to slow down our physical activity, at the same time as the ven-tral vagus allows a feeling of safety with another person. This is discussed in further detail below.
  The second hybrid state expresses itself in friendly competition. We may fight extremely hard to win in sports or games, but this occurs within a framework of safety and rules to which all of the opponents have agreed in advance. In this hybrid state, the fight or flight response of spinal sympathetic chain activation is combined with the feelings of safety associated with activity of the ventral vagus branch. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy13h6jzgx108g3r210m2qtd))
- The three neural pathways of the ANS
  The first of the autonomic nervous system’s neural pathways is the social-engagement nervous system. It involves activity in the ventral branch of the vagus nerve (CN X) and four other cranial nerves (CN V, VII, IX, and XI). Activity in this circuit has a calming, soothing effect, and promotes rest and restitution.
  The ventral branch of the vagus nerve relates to positive emotions of joy, satisfaction, and love. In terms of behavior, it expresses itself in positive social activities with friends and loved ones. The state of social engagement supports social behaviors in which we support and share with other people. Cooperation with others usually improve our chances for survival—we talk together, sing together, dance together, share a meal, cooperate to complete a project, teach and nurture children, etc.
  The second of the ANS’s neural pathways is the spinal sympathetic chain, which is activated when our survival is threatened. If we mobi-lize our body with this response, we can make an extra effort to help us respond to the threat. This state of “mobilization with fear” arises when we are not safe, or do not feel safe. The spinal sympathetic chain relates to emotions of anger or fear, which can express themselves in behaviors such as fighting in order to overcome the threat or fleeing to avoid a threatening situation.
  The third neural pathway is the dorsal branch of the vagus nerve. This pathway is activated when we face an overwhelming force and imminent destruction. When there is no point in fighting or running away, we con-serve what resources we have—we immobilize. Activation of this pathway fosters feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and apathy, manifesting in withdrawal and shutdown. This state can be described as “immobiliza-tion with fear.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy13kspyby8y66cyp05benyb))
- The old stress/relaxation model considered stress to be the opposite of relaxation. It did not describe what happens to the visceral organs in the physiological state of shock or the related emotional state of depression—both of which express immobilization with fear. Nor was there an appreciation of the separate physical structures in the nervous system that are responsible for shock or depressive feelings on one hand and social engagement on the other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy2r43a3y0bw5jvjq0c5vvdt))
- Ideally, when the threat passes, activation of the sympathetic chain should also dissipate. If our nervous system is resilient and flexible, our nervous system should naturally return to a state of social engagement. If this does not occur, and activation of the sympathetic chain becomes chronic, it is not good for our physical and emotional health or our social relationships. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy2r54x8krfa246hg88cecnz))
- When used as a defensive strategy, the sympathetic nervous system helps us maximize our ability to fight or to flee. If a person is socially engaged, their sympathetic nervous system can also be temporarily activated in a positive way, along with the social engagement circuits, to facilitate social interchange in play, sporting competition, and even sexual foreplay.
  Not limited to the act of physically engaging in violence, the fight response includes the full range of other behaviors aimed at changing things by force: verbal aggression in the form of sarcasm and abuse, passive aggression (opposing by not taking part), random aggression toward strangers, and wanton destruction of property.
  Similarly, flight is not only the act of running away—it includes actively avoiding people, situations, or places. It can be simply withdrawing from social situations by watching television or taking part in other solitary activities, possibly driven by anxiety or panic attacks.
  Playing violent video games, for instance, might temporarily put our nervous system into a state of arousal and fight, and being addicted to these games and playing them continually might keep us in that state ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy5n1ced39ggejtvvdbbxqvf))

- A new understanding of stress
  Although many people talk about being stressed, a large percentage of them are not actually stressed in terms of spinal sympathetic chain activity. Physiologically, some of them are actually in a state of dorsal vagal activity (shutdown or withdrawal); in emotional terms, they are in a depressed state.
  This condition can be the result of a traumatic incident sometime in the past. They may have a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress even if they are not physiologically in an actual state of sympathetic-chain stress. According to the Polyvagal Theory, their state is better described as activation of the dorsal branch of the vagus nerve, and these individuals may accordingly suffer from lethargy and immobilization.
  The way to move people out of both states—stress with accompanying fight-or-flight behaviors (mobilization with fear) and depressive feelings behaviors with shutdown (immobilization with fear)—is to activate the ventral branch of their vagus nerve.

- Neuroception and Faulty Neuroception
  “Neuroception” is a term coined by Stephen Porges to describe how neural circuits distinguish whether a situation is safe, threatening, or dangerous. It is an ongoing process through which our autonomic nervous system evaluates information from our senses about our environment and the state of our body.
  Neuroception takes place in the primitive parts of the brain, beyond our conscious awareness. It can be likened to a good watchdog that is always on guard, allowing us to focus on things other than survival, or to sleep soundly, and rousing us only when intrusions could compromise our survival ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy6az8taxb1dyvft1n8n2gr9))
- However, neuroception can be faulty, and when it does not work as it should we can find ourselves in deep trouble. Instead of clearly perceiv-ing what is actually there, we distort what is going on. Faulty neurocep-tion occurs when the neural circuits from perception to behavior do not function in an appropriate way. A person might react to a safe situation as if it were threatening or dangerous, or react to a dangerous situation as if it were safe. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyfn3g7yzb7pfwjdb9kcph9e))
- The nervous system should be flexible, enabling our whole organism to adapt to the present situation and to support different kinds of behav-iors depending on whether the situation is safe, threatening, or danger-ous. In cases of chemical interference (such as prescription medicines, other drugs, and alcohol), information comes in from the environment through our senses, but the neural circuits do not process the information normally, and our physiology does not respond appropriately.

- Today there are many systems, including Pilates, yoga, martial arts, and mindfulness meditations, that help restore people to their sense of their body.

- We can experience these rapid changes of facial expression when two people who feel safe with each other make eye contact, look at each other, and allow their feelings to flow without censoring or trying to control them. This is a reflection of the ideal state of openness, when our facial emotional expressions change as quickly as our thoughts. It is far differ-ent from a put-on smile, as when posing for a photo, where we almost grimace in an attempt to show positive feelings.
  Can you see a flow of emotions on someone else’s face—slight, rapidly changing, mercurial facial movements showing he feels happy, satisfied, angry, irritated, afraid, anxious, sad, or depressed—or is his face flat and unchanging, stuck in one emotional expression? Does he have melodic changes (prosody) in his vocal expression when he speaks? Or is his voice flat, with words spoken in a monotone?

- Objectively Evaluating Vagal Function through Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
  In scientific research on the autonomic nervous system, there is increas-ing awareness of *heart rate variability,* which may offer us another way to assess vagal nerve function.
  When our nervous system is functioning optimally and we are socially engaged, there are differences in the length of time between consecutive heartbeats, resulting from the natural rise and fall of the heart rate in response to breathing, blood pressure, hormones, and emotions. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the measurement of these differences. Greater variation in the time intervals is designated as high HRV. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy6emcvqh8vkyg57hxw21xtv))
- With this realization, I no longer questioned my ability as a therapist when I had a difficult case; the shortcoming was not in me or my technique, but was due to the unreceptive state of the client’s autonomic nervous system. What would happen if I had the information about their autonomic nervous system issues at the start of the session, and addressed that first? I began to do this.
  Based on my resultant clinical successes, I believe that the importance of testing for the function of the ventral branch of the vagus nerve cannot be overestimated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy6brvfmnphn3fhnzrxzzkdz))
- using the pharyngeal-branch vagal function test described below, since my first goal as a therapist is to improve their vagal function.
  If I find ventral vagal dysfunction, indicating a state of either stress or withdrawal, I have the client do the Basic Exercise (see Part Two). Then I test them again. Usually their vagus nerve responds as it should after doing this exercise once or twice. Then I proceed with specific techniques to complete the treatment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy6bsdgwrnnw726j6bdk1bzt))
- It would be easy to conclude that Rolfing simply works better for younger men than for older men. But the researchers were interested in relating the results of the technique to a factor other than age. They discovered that the state of the autonomic nervous system was a relevant indicator in predicting the success of the outcome.
  Before the treatments in the experiment, John measured the subjects’ heart rate variability (HRV). He attached sensors to their skin and ran these wires to a vagal-tone monitor stationed in another room. With this setup, he was able to precisely record changes in the beating of their hearts, and to correlate them to individual breaths ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy6bx8fsrbg0d2rvdbdxbs36))

- In these drawings, you can see the *levator veli palatini* muscles embed-ded in the soft tissue, one on either side of the uvula. These muscles are innervated by motor fibers of the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy6ekba4scj5rfpd47rgy4pn))
- In order to test vagal function, I ask the other person to say, “ah-ah-ah-ah-ah” while I observe the arches on either side of the uvula. These sounds should be percussive and staccato—short, distinct bursts of sound in quick succession, and not a long, drawn-out “aaaaaaaaahhhh,” which does not create the desired effect. If there is good function in the pharyngeal branch of the ventral vagus nerve on both the right and left sides, these muscles tighten symmetrically with a clear impulse when the person makes the sounds “ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,” lifting the arches of the soft palate equally on both sides.
  If, on the other hand, there is dysfunction of the pharyngeal branch of the ventral branch of the vagus nerve on one side, the nerve impulses do not innervate the *levator veli palatini* muscle on that side, and the arch in the soft palate on that side does not lift when the person says “ah ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy6ekg1w4rw7nhmyvng7ez6j))
- 1. Put your hands behind the back of your head, with the weight of your head resting comfortably on your interwoven fingers. You should feel the hardness of your cranium with your fingers, and you should feel the bones of your fingers on the back of your head. If you have a stiff shoulder and cannot bring both of your hands up behind the back of your head, it is sufficient to use one hand, with the fingers and palm contacting both sides of the back of your head.
  2. Keeping your head in place, look to the right, moving only your eyes, as far as you comfortably can. Do not turn your head; just move your eyes. Keep looking to the right (Figure 7).
  3. 4. After a short period of time—up to thirty or even sixty seconds—you will swallow, yawn, or sigh. This is a sign of relaxation in your autonomic nervous system. (A normal inbreath is followed by an outbreath, but a sigh is different—after you breathe in, a second inbreath follows on top of the first inbreath, before the outbreath.)

- Cervical vertebrae and ventral vagal dysfunction
  When I test clients and find that they have ventral vagal dysfunction, I also observe that they have an upper cervical misalignment—i.e., a rotation of the vertebrae C1 (the atlas) and a tipping of C2 (the axis) away from their optimal positions. Using the Basic Exercise almost always brings my clients back into a better alignment of C1 and C2, and when I test them again I find that they have proper ventral vagal function ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy6ewh0g37a4gbzzcrndfw5x))
- From my clinical observations, I believe that it only takes one negative thought to bring C1 and C2 out of joint, affecting our posture and physiology.
  I demonstrated this a few times in my advanced craniosacral classes. First, I had the students observe the position of my C1. I lay on my back, and my students could determine the position of my C1 by gently plac-ing the pads of their thumbs on its transverse processes. If there was no rotation of C1, their thumbs would be close to horizontal. However, if one thumb was higher than the other, that would indicate a rotation of the vertebra.
  At the start of the experiment, a student observed that his thumbs were horizontal. Then I simply thought about something that was disturbing to me. Immediately, the transverse processes of C1 moved; one side went up and the other went down. The position of C1 felt like it had rotated approximately forty-five degrees away from the horizontal, with one side up (anterior) and the other side down (posterior). (Though this observation is counter to the actual anatomical possibilities for C1 alone to rotate, it is what it feels like under your thumbs if you have them lightly monitoring the transverse processes of C1. The only explanation I have is that the rotation must be a complex combination of the repositioning of C1, C2, and C3 taken together. C1 must somehow slide out of the joint so that it can turn even further.)
  I found the experience highly unpleasant, since I had to undergo a change of state away from social engagement. The other students in the class could see a change in my breathing, and a loss of color in my face. Then I had my student perform our hands-on technique for myofascial release (see “Neuro-Fascial Release Technique,” on page 195) to realign my C1 and C2.

- Level 1: the Half-Salamander Exercise
  To do the first part of the Salamander Exercise to the right, sit or stand in a comfortable position.
  1. Without turning your head, let your eyes look to the right.
  2. Continuing to face straight forward, tilt your head to the right so that your right ear moves closer to your right shoulder, without lifting the shoulder to meet it (Figure 10). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy6f9y1xgz1rymcnm0f7zpah))
- 1. Hold your head in this position for thirty to sixty seconds.
  2. Then let your head come back up to neutral, and shift your eyes to look forward again.
  3. Now do the same on the other side: let your eyes look to the left, and then side-bend your head to the left. After thirty to sixty seconds, return your head to an upright position, and your eyes to a forward direction.
  The Half-Salamander—a variation
  In this variation on the Half-Salamander Exercise, follow the same instructions above, but let your eyes look to the *right* while tipping your head to the *left* (Figure 11). This movement of your eyes in the opposite direction before you move your head increases your range of motion; you should be able to side-bend your head even further to the left. Hold this for thirty to sixty seconds, and then reverse to do the same thing on the other side ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy6fa6bvftdeppykdzx3mfqz))
