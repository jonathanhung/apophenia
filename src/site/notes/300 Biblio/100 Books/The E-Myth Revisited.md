- The question has often been asked of me, “What do the owners of extraordinary businesses know that the rest don’t?” Contrary to popular belief, my experience has shown me that the people who are exceptionally good in business aren’t so because of what they know but because of their insatiable need to know more. The problem with most failing businesses I’ve encountered is not that their owners don’t know enough about finance, marketing, management, and operations—they don’t, but those things are easy enough to learn—but that they spend their time and energy defending what they think they know. The greatest businesspeople I’ve met are determined to get it right no matter what the cost. And by getting it right, I’m not just talking about the business. I mean that there is something uplifting, some vision, some higher end in sight that “getting it right” would serve. An ethical certainty, a moral principle, a universal truth. ([Location 67](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=67))
- Indeed, the problem is not that the owners of small businesses in this country don’t work; the problem is that they’re doing the wrong work. As a result, most of their businesses end up in chaos—unmanageable, unpredictable, and unrewarding. ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=115))
- Businesses start and fail in the United States at an increasingly staggering rate. Every year, over a million people in this country start a business of some sort. Statistics tell us that by the end of the first year at least 40 percent of them will be out of business.1 Within five years, more than 80 percent of them—800,000—will have failed. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=117))
- It’s about four profound ideas, which, if you understand and take them to heart, will give you the power to create an extraordinarily exciting, and personally rewarding, small business. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=126))
- IDEA #1 There is a myth in this country—I call it the E-Myth—which says that small businesses are started by entrepreneurs risking capital to make a profit. This is simply not so. The real reasons people start businesses have little to do with entrepreneurship. In fact, this belief in the Entrepreneurial Myth is the most important factor in the devastating rate of small business failure today. ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=130))
- And what makes people work is an idea worth working for, along with a clear understanding of what needs to be done. It is only when such an idea becomes firmly integrated into the way you think and operate your business that “how to do it” becomes meaningful. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=153))
- This book is about such an idea—an idea that says your business is nothing more than a distinct reflection of who you are. If your thinking is sloppy, your business will be sloppy. If you are disorganized, your business will be disorganized. If you are greedy, your employees will be greedy, giving you less and less of themselves and always asking for more. If your information about what needs to be done in your business is limited, your business will reflect that limitation. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=156))
- Of the thousands of businesspeople I have had the opportunity to know and work with over the past two decades, few were real entrepreneurs when I met them. The vision was all but gone in most. The zest for the climb had turned into a terror of heights. The face of the rock had become something to cling to rather than to scale. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=181))
- That Fatal Assumption is: if you understand the technical work of a business, you understand a business that does that technical work. And the reason it’s fatal is that it just isn’t true. In fact, it’s the root cause of most small business failures! ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=222))
- I told Sarah that every technician suffering from an Entrepreneurial Seizure experiences exactly the same thing. First, exhilaration; second, terror; third, exhaustion; and, finally, despair. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=287))
- The problem is that everybody who goes into business is actually three-people-in-one: The Entrepreneur, The Manager, and The Technician. And the problem is compounded by the fact that while each of these personalities wants to be the boss, none of them wants to have a boss. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=301))
- And so when The Skinny Guy decides to change things we actually believe that it’s I who’s making that decision. And when The Fat Guy wakes up and changes it all back again, we think it’s I who’s making that decision too. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=340))
- The problem is that when you’re The Skinny Guy, you’re totally consumed by his needs, his interests, his lifestyle. And then something happens—the scale disappoints you, the weather turns cold, somebody offers you a ham sandwich. At that moment, The Fat Guy, who’s been waiting in the wings all this time, grabs your attention. Grabs control. You’re him again. In other words, when you’re The Skinny Guy you’re always making promises for The Fat Guy to keep. And when you’re The Fat Guy, you’re always making promises for The Skinny Guy to keep. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=345))
- The entrepreneurial personality turns the most trivial condition into an exceptional opportunity. The Entrepreneur is the visionary in us. The dreamer. The energy behind every human activity. The imagination that sparks the fire of the future. The catalyst for change. The Entrepreneur lives in the future, never in the past, rarely in the present. He’s happiest when left free to construct images of “what-if” and “if-when.” ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=360))
- Every strong entrepreneurial personality has an extraordinary need for control. Living as he does in the visionary world of the future, he needs control of people and events in the present so that he can concentrate on his dreams. Given his need for change, The Entrepreneur creates a great deal of havoc around him, which is predictably unsettling for those he enlists in his projects. As a result, he often finds himself rapidly outdistancing the others. The farther ahead he is, the greater the effort required to pull his cohorts along. This then becomes the entrepreneurial worldview: a world made up of both an overabundance of opportunities and dragging feet. The problem is, how can he pursue the opportunities without getting mired down by the feet? The way he usually chooses is to bully, harass, excoriate, flatter, cajole, scream, and finally, when all else fails, promise whatever he must to keep the project moving. To The Entrepreneur, most people are problems that get in the way of the dream. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=369))
- The Manager is the part of us that goes to Sears and buys stacking plastic boxes, takes them back to the garage, and systematically stores all the various sized nuts, bolts, and screws in their own carefully identified drawer. He then hangs all of the tools in impeccable order on the walls—lawn tools on one wall, carpentry tools on another—and, to be absolutely certain that order is not disturbed, paints a picture of each tool on the wall where it hangs! If The Entrepreneur lives in the future, The Manager lives in the past. Where The Entrepreneur craves control, The Manager craves order. Where The Entrepreneur thrives on change, The Manager compulsively clings to the status quo. Where The Entrepreneur invariably sees the opportunity in events, The Manager invariably sees the problems. The Manager builds a house and then lives in it, forever. The Entrepreneur builds a house and the instant it’s done begins planning the next one. The Manager creates neat, orderly rows of things. The Entrepreneur creates the things The Manager puts in rows. The Manager is the one who runs after The Entrepreneur to clean up the mess. Without The Entrepreneur there would be no mess to clean up. Without The Manager, there could be no business, no society. Without The Entrepreneur, there would be no innovation. It ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=380))
- To The Technician, thinking is unproductive unless it’s thinking about the work that needs to be done. As a result, he is suspicious of lofty ideas or abstractions. Thinking isn’t work; it gets in the way of work. The Technician isn’t interested in ideas; he’s interested in “how to do it.” To The Technician, all ideas need to be reduced to methodology if they are to be of any value. And with good reason. The Technician knows that if it weren’t for him, the world would be in more trouble than it already is. Nothing would get done, but lots of people would be thinking about it. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=402))
- “So it is that an entrepreneurial business, without a Manager to give it order and without a Technician to put it to work, is doomed to suffer an early, and probably very dramatic, death. And that a Manager-driven business, without an Entrepreneur or a Technician to play their absolutely critical roles, will put things into little gray boxes over and over again, only to realize too late that there’s no reason for the things or the boxes she put them into! Such a business will die very neatly. “And that in a Technician-driven business, without The Entrepreneur to lead her and The Manager to supervise her, The Technician will work until she drops, only to wake up the next morning to go to work even harder, and the next, and the next. Only to discover, long after it’s too late, that while she was working someone moved a freeway through the store!” ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=458))
- I call it Future Work. ‘I wonder’ is the true work of the entrepreneurial personality.” ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=486))
- It is self-evident that business, like people, are suposed to grow; and with growth, comes change. Unfortunately, most businesses are not run according to this principle. Instead most businesses are operated according to what the owner wants as opposed to what the business needs. And what The Technician who runs the company wants is not growth or change but exactly the opposite. He wants a place to go to work, free to do what he wants, when he wants, free from the constraints of work ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=497))
- In the beginning nothing is too much for your business to ask. As The Technician, you’re accustomed to “paying your dues.” So the hours devoted to the business during Infancy are not spent grudgingly but optimistically. There’s work to be done, and that’s what you’re all about. After all, your middle name is Work. “Besides,” you think, “this work is for me.” And so you work. Ten, twelve, fourteen hours a day. Seven days a week. Even when you’re at home, you’re at work. All your thoughts, all your feelings, revolve around your new business. You can’t get it out of your mind. You’re consumed by it; totally invested in doing whatever is necessary to keep it alive. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=507))
- “There’s nothing wrong with being a Technician. There’s only something wrong with being a Technician who also owns a business! Because as a Technician-turned-business-owner, your focus is upside down. You see the world from the bottom up rather than from the top down. You have a tactical view rather than a strategic view. You see the work that has to get done, and because of the way you’re built, you immediately jump in to do it! You believe that a business is nothing more than an aggregate of the various types of work done in it, when in fact it is much more than that. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=555))
- “Don’t you see? If your business depends on you, you don’t own a business—you have a job. And it’s the worst job in the world because you’re working for a lunatic! “And, besides, that’s not the purpose of going into business. “The purpose of going into business is to get free of a job so you can create jobs for other people. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=584))
- What Harry knows, and what you’re about to learn, is that it’s only the beginning of a process in which the balls begin to fall faster and with greater frequency than they ever did when you were doing everything yourself. And as the thud of the landing balls becomes deafening, you begin to realize that you never should have trusted Harry. You never should have trusted anyone. You should have known better. As the balls continue to fall at an overwhelming rate, you begin to realize that no one cares about your business the way you do. That no one is willing to work as hard as you work. That no one has your judgment, or your ability, or your desire, or your interest. ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=695))
- “Going-for-broke” businesses are a sign of our time. They are a high-tech phenomenon. With the explosion of new technology and the numbers of those who create it, a whole new breed of technicians has flocked to the business arena. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=787))
- The demand for the commodity of which they are so proud quickly exceeds their chronically Adolescent ability to produce it. ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=795))
- “The tragedy is that all this could have been prevented had the business been started differently, had The Technician suffering from an Entrepreneurial Seizure approached the business in a broader, more entrepreneurial way. “Of course, you couldn’t have anticipated everything that has happened to you so far in your business,” I said to Sarah, “but you could have anticipated much of it. “You could have anticipated what happened to Elizabeth and the people she hired. “You could have anticipated that people would love your pies and that the business would therefore have to grow. “You could have anticipated that growth would bring additional responsibilities, additional skills required, additional capital needed to respond to the added demand that growth always places on a business and on people. “In short, while you couldn’t have known everything, you could certainly have known more than you do. “And that’s your job, Sarah! The job of the owner. And if you don’t do it, nobody will. “Simply put, your job is to prepare yourself and your business for growth. “To educate yourself sufficiently so that, as your business grows, the business’s foundation and structure can carry the additional weight. “And as awesome a responsibility as that may seem to you, you have no other choice—if your business is to thrive, that is. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=901))
- “But all the while, even while you’re guessing, the key is to plan, envision, and articulate what you see in the future both for yourself and for your employees. Because if you don’t articulate it—I mean, write it down, clearly, so others can understand it—you don’t own it! And do you know that in all the years I’ve been doing this work with small business owners, out of the thousands upon thousands we’ve met, there have only been a few who had any plan at all! Nothing written, nothing committed to paper, nothing concrete at all. “Remember, Sarah, any plan is better than no plan. “Because in the process of defining the future, the plan begins to shape itself to reality, both the reality of the world out there and the reality you are able to create in here.

- IBM is what it is today for three special reasons. The first reason is that, at the very beginning, I had a very clear picture of what the company would look like when it was finally done. You might say I had a model in my mind of what it would look like when the dream—my vision—was in place. The second reason was that once I had that picture, I then asked myself how a company which looked like that would have to act. I then created a picture of how IBM would act when it was finally done. The third reason IBM has been so successful was that once I had a picture of how IBM would look when the dream was in place and how such a company would have to act, I then realized that, unless we began to act that way from the very beginning, we would never get there. ([Location 970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=970))
- Every day at IBM was a day devoted to business development, not doing business. ([Location 982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=982))
- It tells us that it is the Entrepreneurial Perspective that says it’s not the commodity or the work itself that is important. What’s important is the business: how it looks, how it acts, how it does what it is intended to do. It says that Tom Watson Sr. had a passion for the enterprise itself. ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=993))
- Each step in the development of such a business is measurable, if not quantitatively, at least, qualitatively. There’s a standard for the business, a form, a way of being that can be translated into things to do today that best exemplify it. The business operates according to articulated rules and principles. It has a clear, recognizable form. ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1013))
- With The Technician’s Perspective, however, the scale is narrower, more inhibited, confined principally to the work being done. As a result, The Technician’s business becomes increasingly oppressive, less exhilarating, closed off from the larger world outside. His business is reduced to steps that fail to take him anywhere other than to the next step, itself nothing more than a replica of the one before it. Routine becomes the order of the day. Work is done for work’s sake alone, forsaking any higher ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1016))
- What exactly is the Entrepreneurial Model? It’s a model of a business that fulfills the perceived needs of a specific segment of customers in an innovative way. ([Location 1027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1027))
- To The Entrepreneur, however, the customer is always an opportunity. Because The Entrepreneur knows that within the customer is a continuing parade of changing wants begging to be satisfied. All The Entrepreneur has to do is find out what ([Location 1045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1045))
- What we must do, instead, is discover a model that sparks the entrepreneurial imagination in each of us with such a resounding shock that by the time The Technician wakes up to the fact it will be too late, ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1057))
- The Business Format Franchise not only lends its name to the smaller enterprise but it also provides the franchisee with an entire system of doing business. ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1127))
- resides in the success of the product it sells. To the trade name franchisor, the value of the franchise lies in the value of the brand name that it is licensing: Cadillac, Mercedes, Coca-Cola. There was a time when that belief was true, but it isn’t anymore. In a world where brand names proliferate like snowflakes in a Minnesota blizzard, it becomes more and more difficult—and infinitely more expensive—to establish a secure position with a brand name and expect to keep it. As a result, trade name franchises have been declining over the same period that franchising in general has been exploding at an unprecedented rate. It is the Business Format Franchise that has accounted for that growth. Because the Business Format Franchise is built on the belief that the true product of a business is not what it sells but how it sells it. The true product of a business is the business itself.

- Ray Kroc loved producing an exceptional result, the same way, with the same impact, time after time. As certainly as you loved the aroma, the smells, the sight, the taste, of your kitchen, Ray Kroc loved the aroma, the smells, the sight, the taste of McDonald’s. He was a man in love. ([Location 1202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1202))
- “Because it can do in its more than 28,000 stores what most of us can’t do in one! “And to me, that’s what integrity is all about. It’s about doing what you say you will do, and, if you can’t, learning how. ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1210))
- To The Entrepreneur, the Franchise Prototype is the medium through which his vision takes form in the real world. To The Manager, the Franchise Prototype provides the order, the predictability, the system so important to his life. To The Technician, the Prototype is a place in which he is free to do the things he loves to do—technical work. And to the small business owner, the Franchise Prototype provides the means through which he can finally feed his three personalities in a balanced way while creating a business that works. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1282))
- It is a proprietary way of doing business that successfully and preferentially differentiates every extraordinary business from every one of its competitors. In this light, every great business in the world is a franchise. ([Location 1295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1295))
- The point is: your business is not your life. Your business and your life are two totally separate things.

- 1. The model will provide consistent value to your customers, employees, suppliers, and lenders, beyond what they expect. 2. The model will be operated by people with the lowest possible level of skill. 3. The model will stand out as a place of impeccable order. 4.

- from a practical point of view may have great emotional meaning through their symbolism. Images and colors are often great motivating forces. Some time ago we conducted a study of women shopping in an apparel shop. A young woman wanted to buy a blouse that was available in several colors. She held the blue blouse up to her face and looked into the mirror. She was a blonde and she knew she looked good ([Location 1457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1457))
- in blue. She fingered the red one lovingly. She loved the color, she thought, but she said it was too strong and loud. The salesgirl reminded her that yellow was the fashionable color. She could not make up her mind between the color that she looked best in, the color she liked best, and the color in current fashion, so she settled on a gray blouse. It was reported to me a couple of weeks later that she didn’t like the gray blouse. “It was dead,” she said. She wore it only twice.

- Think of your business as anything but a job!

- a serious business you need a process, a practice, by which to obtain that information and, once obtained, a method with which to put that information to use in your business productively. ([Location 1499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1499))

- Building the Prototype of your business is a continuous process, a Business Development Process. Its foundation is three distinct yet thoroughly integrated activities through which your business can pursue its natural evolution. They are Innovation, Quantification, and Orchestration. ([Location 1547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1547))
- Innovation is the heart of every exceptional business. Innovation continually poses the question: What is standing in the way of my customer getting what he wants from my business? ([Location 1592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1592))
- Innovation, then, is the mechanism through which your business identifies itself in the mind of your customer and establishes its individuality. It is the result of a scientifically generated and quantifiably verified profile of your customer’s perceived needs and unconscious expectations. ([Location 1596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1596))
- Orchestration is the elimination of discretion, or choice, at the operating level of your business. Without Orchestration, nothing could be planned, and nothing anticipated—by you or your customer. If you’re doing everything differently each time you do it, if everyone in your company is doing it by their own discretion, their own choice, rather than creating order, you’re creating chaos. ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000RO9VJK&location=1640))
- experienced in our work with small businesses is that, as the Business Development Process becomes an integral part of the business, it also becomes an integral part of the communication between the participants. It becomes not only a way of thinking and a way of doing but a way of being as well.

- Having created a picture of the business as it will look when it’s finally done, Jack and Murray start the prototyping process. But at the bottom of the organization, not at the top. They start working on the business where they start working in the business. In the position of Salesperson and Production Person and Accounts Receivable Clerk. Not as the owners or partners or shareholders. Not as the COO or the VP/Marketing. But as employees, at the very bottom of the organization. Doing Tactical Work, not Strategic Work. Tactical Work is the work all technicians do. Strategic Work is the work their managers do. If Jack and Murray’s business is going to thrive, they have to find other people to do the Tactical Work so as to free Jack and Murray to do the Strategic Work.

Each of them asks, “What would best serve our customer here? How could I most easily give the customer what he wants while also maximizing profits for the company? And at the same time, how could I give the person responsible for that work the best possible experience?” Murray begins to test the clothing he wears as a Salesperson to see what colors and styles produce the greatest positive impact on the customers.

- “He said, ‘The work we do is a reflection of who we are. If we’re sloppy at it, it’s because we’re sloppy inside. If we’re late at it, it’s because we’re late inside. If we’re bored by it, it’s because we’re bored inside, with ourselves, not with the work. The most menial work can be a piece of art when done by an artist. So the job here is not outside of ourselves, but inside of ourselves. How we do our work becomes a mirror of how we are inside.

- “And the rules of the game—what a joy it’s going to be to create them. Rules about dress. Rules about comportment. Rules about the tools we use and how we use them. Rules about the floor and the walls and the counterspace, how we clean them every night and every morning, how we give them their final touch so that they absolutely glow! Rules about the pie tins and about the cupboards in which we store things. Rules about glass, rules about silver, rules about tin. Rules about the ovens, how they’re heated, how they’re opened and closed, how they’re cleaned. Rules about opening up, and closing up. Rules about money, about keeping the books, about balancing at the end of each day. Rules about hair, about fingernails!” Sarah’s eyes were flashing as she poured out the beginning of her vision, as her vision began to take shape.
