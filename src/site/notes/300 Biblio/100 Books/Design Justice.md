Design justice provides a normative and pragmatic proposal for a liberatory approach to design. A designer can adopt this approach by rethinking design processes, centering historically marginalized communities in design decisions, and aiming for a more equitable distribution of design’s benefits and burdens. This approach emphasizes fair and meaningful participation in design decisions and recognizes community-based, Indigenous, and diasporic design traditions, knowledge, and practices. The Design Justice Network provides practical guides to help designers put design justice into practice. Retooling for design justice may involve developing new approaches to key design methods like A/B tests, benchmarks, user testing, and validation. At the level of the nation-state, there is a need for policy changes to shift priorities toward research and design that center the needs of historically marginalized communities.
 The Design Justice book explores who participates in design processes historically and typically, sites for communal participation, and the limits for participation due to daily pressures and multiple literacies required. The book examines the growing community of designers and technologists who are working to transform design narratives, sites, values, and pedagogies, challenging structural inequality and promoting inclusive design. The author highlights various projects, groups, and networks that are committed to this goal, including the Inclusive Design Research Centre, Decolonising Design, and the Center for Media Justice. The chapter also examines the central role of design narratives as an arena of contestation for the theory and practice of design justice.
 The most important take-aways for designers engaging in a collaborative design process with marginalized communities are to approach the design process with a normative and pragmatic proposal for a liberatory approach to design justice, work to center historically marginalized communities in design processes, adopt strategies for community accountability and control, engage with fundamental questions about the definition of community, and decenter Western approaches to design pedagogy while centering design approaches, histories, theories, and practices rooted in indigenous communities. It is also important to develop clear, transparent, and explicit decision-making processes and to find ways to compensate community partners for their time on the project.

- Design justice is an approach that asks us to focus sustained attention on these questions, beginning with “how does the matrix of domination shape affordance perceptibility and availability?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6fd3m695akds85rqffqv8t9))
- in addition to perceptibility, design justice impels us to consider whether a given affordance is *equally available* to all people. For example, stairs (another example provided by Gaver) afford moving between two levels of a home for most people but deny this affordance to those whose type of mobility makes stairs difficult or impossible to use. For these users, stairs may provide a *perceptible but unavailable* affordance ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6kkbrmd4f7yrs62ayqdhj4h))
- In a paper about discriminatory design, philosopher of technology D. E. Wittkower provides many examples of disaffordances: a fence *disaffords* entry to a plot of land; a lock on a door *disaffords* entry without a key; and a fingerprint scanner on a mobile phone affords access to the phone’s content for the owner, while it disaffords access to all others.[24](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/75357405#en112) Wittkower also identifies *dysaffordances* (a subcategory of disaffordances), a term he uses for an object that requires some users to misidentify themselves to access its functions. For example, as a nonbinary person, I experience a dysaffordance any time I interact with a system, such as air-travel ticketing, that forces me to select either Male or Female to proceed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6kkdy32jtk761knjgfcbp0v))
- Most designers, most of the time, do not think of themselves as sexist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, ableist, or settler-colonialist. Some may consider themselves to be capitalist, but few identify as part of the ruling class. Many feel themselves to be in tension with capitalism, and many even identify as socialist. However, design justice is not about intentionality; it is about process and outcomes. Design justice asks whether the affordances of a designed object or system disproportionally reduce opportunities for already oppressed groups of people while enhancing the life opportunities of dominant groups, independently of whether designers intend this outcome ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6kkrh6dzndyfb4f5zfab66q))
- *design* means to make a mark, make a plan, or problem-solve; all human beings thus participate in design.[12](#en214) However, though all humans design, not everyone gets paid to do so. Intersectional inequality systematically structures paid professional design work. Professional design jobs in nearly all fields are disproportionately allocated to people who occupy highly privileged locations within the matrix of domination.

- Instead, design justice compels us to begin by listening to community organizers, learning what they are working on, and asking what the most useful focus of design efforts would be. In this way, design processes can be community-led, rather than designer- or funder-led. Another way to put this might be: “Don’t start by building a new table; start by coming to the table.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6kw3kg30m2perx2zcxr5pbs))
- We will be working to design and develop real world projects, grounded in the needs of CBOs. As a student in the course, you will be part of a co-design team led by a partner organization. … The studio is also a space for shared inquiry into the theory, history, best practices, and critiques of various approaches to community inclusion in iterative stages of project ideation, design, implementation, testing, and evaluation. The Civic Media Codesign Studio approaches communities not as (solely) consumers, test subjects, “test beds,” or objects of study, but instead imagines them as co-designers and coauthors of shared knowledge, technologies, narratives, and social practices. Our goal is twofold: to develop an understanding of the ways that technology design processes often replicate existing power inequalities, while at the same time, moving beyond critique towards community coauthorship, as much as possible within the constraints of any given project.

- There is thus an important tension within a design justice approach between dealing with the larger, long-term forces of structural inequality and the need to make something concrete in the here and now that can contribute to sustaining, healing, or empowering a community.

- Of course, in theory, design justice calls for both equitable design processes and just design outcomes. However, in practice, all design projects have limited resources and limited time, and there are nearly always trade-offs between the inclusivity of a process and the need to ship a product. Put another way, there are real tensions between those design justice principles that emphasize an inclusive design process and those that prioritize impact on a community over the designers’ intentions. A design project may be wonderfully inclusive, provide all participants with a sense of ownership, and reward people equitably for their work, but fail to produce a design product that is useful to the community. Alternately, a process that is not at all inclusive may produce a product that is useful and widely loved. These tensions are not fully resolvable, but they also do not invalidate design justice practitioners’ attempts to pay attention to both procedural and distributive justice.

- Designer and scholar Carl DiSalvo argues for *adversarial design*, an approach rooted in the political theory of agonism. DiSalvo urges designers to create contestational objects, challenge hegemonic power structures, and offer speculative alternatives. As DiSalvo says, “Design can produce a shift toward action that models alternative presents and possible futures in material and experiential form.”[34](#en678) Another approach might be to engage in parallel pragmatics/utopics: to systematically and explicitly develop radical, or utopian, design solutions within the context of each design project, either at an early stage (during ideation) or alongside and in parallel with the pragmatic design product. The design process itself then becomes an exercise in radical visioning: the design team, led by people from the most directly affected community, explores the root of the problem and develops ideas for systems change, in addition to ideas for products or services that can be implemented within the resource limitations of the project. In this way, design outputs include greater understanding of multilevel problems, proposals for radical transformation, and traditional design outputs. In other words, design becomes part of a praxis of liberation, rather than a tool for, at best, incremental improvement within a context of steadily declining possibilities and, at worst, an extractive instrument for mining ideas from already oppressed communities.
