- Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is. —ISAAC ASIMOV, ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=420))
- “If you put the same amount of time and energy you’d spend completing an MBA into doing good work and improving your skills, you’ll do just as well.” ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=438))
- “It’s hard for me to understand,” he wrote, “why [getting an MBA] is a better use of time and money than actual experience combined with a dedicated reading of 30 or 40 books.” ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=517))
- “Charlie can analyze and evaluate any kind of deal faster and more accurately than any man alive. He sees any valid weakness in sixty seconds. He’s the perfect partner.”3 ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=555))
- Here’s how I define a business: Every successful business (1) creates or provides something of value that (2) other people want or need (3) at a price they’re willing to pay, in a way that (4) satisfies the purchaser’s needs and expectations and (5) provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation. Take away any of these things—value creation, customer demand, transactions, value delivery, or profit sufficiency—and you have something other than a business. Each factor is both essential and universal. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=591))
- Value can’t be created without understanding what people want (market research). ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=596))

- The existence of a market means you’re already on the right side of the Iron Law of the Market, so you can spend more time developing your offer instead of proving a market exists. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=1153))

- more they’ll be willing to pay.

- Ideas are cheap—what counts is the ability to translate an idea into reality, which is much more difficult than recognizing a good idea. ([Location 1567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=1567))
- Critical Assumptions are facts or characteristics that must be true in the real world for your business or offering to be successful. ([Location 1794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=1794))
- Every business or offering has a set of Critical Assumptions that will make or break its continued existence. The more accurately you can identify these assumptions in advance and actually test whether or not they’re true, the less risk you’ll be taking and the more confidence you’ll have in the wisdom of your decisions.

- your prospects are paying attention to something else, not you. In order to attract Attention to your offer, what you’re doing must be more interesting than your prospect’s current subject of attention. ([Location 2032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=2032))
- The best way to break a potential prospect’s Preoccupation is to provoke a feeling of curiosity, surprise, or concern. ([Location 2034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=2034))

([Location 2089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=2089))
- Addressability is a measure of how easy it is to get in touch with people who might want what you’re offering. A highly Addressable audience can be reached quickly and easily.

- it’s almost impossible to make someone want something they don’t already desire. ([Location 2152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=2152))

- I started my teaching and consulting business by giving away my research and writing for Free on my Web site. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people find (or are referred to) the Personal MBA, benefit from the information, and come to trust me as a useful resource. More often than not, they give me permission to continue providing even more useful Free information via e-mail. Periodically, I offer to meet with prospective consulting customers by phone for Free—there’s no obligation whatsoever on their part, ([Location 2227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=2227))

- A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: a complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a simple system. ([Location 6712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0046ECJ8M&location=6712))
