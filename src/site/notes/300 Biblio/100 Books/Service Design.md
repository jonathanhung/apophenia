## Highlights

- Part of the problem is that insurance is complicated, involves multiple stakeholders and channels, and is a classic example of a service that is often sold as a product. The mix of complexity, human experience, multiple stakeholders, and delivery channels, combined with customer dissatisfaction with an industry stuck in its ways, ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=214))
- customer orientation should be a main strategic focus and a key competitive advantage for the firm. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=220))
- staff working in silos. This industrial model made it difficult to orient the silos to work together to deliver a unified experience to customers. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=222))
- knew how to engage the organization. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=226))
- then set about identifying what ultimately amounted to 183 concrete actions to improve customer experience. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=229))
- classic service design—insights research, workshops, service blueprinting, service proposition development, concept sketches and presentations, experience prototyping, testing, and delivery. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=245))
- As with much service design, the challenge is to make the invisible visible, or to make the right things visible and get rid of the noise in the rest of the offering. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=272))
- friends and family were frequently believed to be the best source of insurance advice. People trust their father to give them good advice about an insurance policy more than they trust an insurance agent. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=288))
- some of the processes developed “on the shop floor” ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=344))
- One of the things that hampers product innovation in insurance is the time delay. Organizations only find out whether an innovation will make or lose them money after they see the level of claims, which can take several years. Thus, the insurance industry traditionally is conservative about innovation. The customer insights gathered by the design team helped inspire confidence in bringing new ideas to market. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=362))
- Gjensidige ran co-design workshops with different groups within the company and generated 97 ideas, five of which were chosen for further development. Finally, the team came up with one new service proposition. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=366))
- To test the claims process, they went through the material with someone who had just had an accident. Actual staff and actual customers took part, and even though they knew they were taking part in testing, the conversations they had were very real. Through this process, the project team learned a lot about what needed to be done to shape, explain, and sell the new service proposition. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=389))
- FIGURE 1.5 Creating fake newspaper ads—one for a financial broadsheet, the other for a tabloid—helped the team understand how the marketing of the service ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=398))
- services are created and experienced by interactions between people, often in a completely different context than the usual customer-provider paradigm. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=420))
- Services are usually complex and expensive to roll out. In this case, such a radical change to Gjensidige’s offering was not just radical for them, but for the whole industry. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=431))
- Thinking through radical ideas and prototyping the experience of them helped mature the cultural mindset within the company, and many of the insights have fed into Gjensidige becoming a totally service-oriented company. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=435))
- mapping out the big idea in detail gives organizations an overview of problems and opportunities all in one place, which helps them make strategic decisions about what to deal with when, how those decisions relate to other parts of their business, and how to scale their service innovation up or down according to budgets and resources. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=444))
- The results of these kinds of company-wide changes take time to surface. Two and a half years after starting this process, Gjensidige have seen a dramatic rise ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=460))
- We are saturated with material wealth, and our consumption of products is threatening our very existence rather than being a resource for good living. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=488))
- Service design grows out of a digitally native generation professionally bred on network thinking. Our focus has moved from efficient production to lean consumption, and the value set has moved from standard of living to quality of life. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=492))
- introduce the service experience earlier in their strategic thinking so that a vision for the service experience could impact technical and business decisions rather than the other way around. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=523))
- Spreadsheets are a poor medium for conveying human experiences. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=526))
- “Tangible Evidence from the Future” and designed the experience of 12 new service propositions ranging from new ways to organize call centers to self-service, online plans. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=527))
- Patients in hospitals are kept in the dark about why they have been waiting for hours, or receive contradictory information during one of the most emotionally difficult times of their lives. The division of the silos makes sense to the business units, but makes no sense to the customer, who sees the entire offering as one experience. ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=542))
- The problem is that customers don’t just care about individual touchpoints. They experience services in totality and base their judgment on how well everything works together to provide them with value (Figure 2.3). Another complicating factor is that quality can vary dramatically from one service touchpoint to another. ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=553))
- Services are about interactions between people, and their motivations and behaviors. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=559))
- The biggest missed opportunity in development is that organizations don’t think about their customers as valuable, productive assets in the delivery of a service, but as anonymous consumers of products. ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=578))
- Physical elements and technology can easily be copied, but service experiences are rooted in company culture and are much harder to replicate. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=621))
- good service design is key to the successful introduction of new technologies. Design of new models each year became the recipe ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=625))
- Some of the greatest opportunities are found where a business model can be changed from a product model to a service model. ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=627))
- Core service offerings can be grouped into three primary spheres: care, response, and access. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=636))
- Services That Provide Access to People or Things ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=644))
- Other kinds of access services are those that give access to infrastructure over many years. ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=649))
- These services are often a fundamental part of people’s lives that are typically noticed only when they are disrupted, such as when the daily commuter train is canceled, or when schools are closed due to heavy snow. ([Location 656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=656))
- The third category is services that respond to people’s (often unforeseen) needs. These services are usually a mix of people and things that are able to assist us: an ambulance rushing to an accident, a teacher helping a child with a math problem, or a store assistant finding a customer a pair of jeans with the right fit. Sometimes these “response” services are anticipated and people buy the right to them in advance through insurance policies, social welfare, or simply by their choice of brand experience. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=661))
- but generally prices are similar across the board. The point of difference for any specific service is how it is delivered. We think of this as the performance of the service. ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=687))
- think of an airline such as Virgin, which have gone to great lengths to make the experience of a very rigid flight process different from their competitors by styling the manner, dress, and actions of their inflight team, their digital and print communication, and a host of other touchpoints. ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=700))
- Outward-facing value measurement asks how well the service is achieving the results promised to the service users. For example, how often does a hip operation result in a 100% recovery? Inward-facing value measurement examines how well the service is performing for the organization. For example, how cost effectively is it delivering hip operations? ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=708))
- But “use” and “consume” are product mindset words and we need to use different language for services. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=737))
- It is essential to understand that services are, at the very least, relationships between providers and customers, and more generally, that they are highly complicated networks of relationships between people inside and outside the service organization. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=746))
- We argue that the industrial mode has also led to the stereotypical “faceless corporations” that are often the subject of frustration and poor experiences for service users, because the industrial mindset is usually all about efficiencies and economies of scale rather than effectiveness of the delivered service. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=753))
- The successful businesses and public services of the future will foster a more equal and reciprocal relationship with their customers, one that recognizes the customer as a co-producer of the service. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=764))
- Service design involves research across all the stakeholders of a project—from the managing director to the end user, and from frontline staff to third-party suppliers. Of course, other disciplines focus on detailed knowledge of customers as a business advantage. ([Location 790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=790))
- Marketing excels in understanding markets and how to reach them through the classic four Ps: price, promotion, product, and place. We are focusing on the fifth P, people, and how we work with people to inform the design of a service. ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=795))
- By asking people about their everyday experiences and observing what they do, how they behave, and what their motivations are, we can ground the innovation process with insights into people’s actual lives. In the end, insights that drive innovation confidently answer the question: “Will our offering make sense in the context of people’s lives, and will they find it valuable?” ([Location 826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=826))
- Service design is about designing with people and not just for them, and it is here that it differs from classic user-centered design and much of marketing. “People” does not just mean customers or users, it also means the people working to provide the service, often called frontline, front-of-house, or customer-facing staff. Their experience, both in terms of their knowledge and their engagement in the job, is important to the ongoing success of a service for two key reasons. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=844))
- with a community whose main communication channels were offline, a new program needed to be co-designed as a comprehensive service. We needed buy-in, ownership, and engagement throughout the process from all stakeholders—administrative staff, community managers, and residents—so the program would fit into their lives and thrive beyond our involvement. ([Location 854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=854))
- To connect with the community and to start building trust early on, we met casually but continually with people outside of formal research and design sessions. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=864))
- Because they helped to define the language and framework for the new program, residents began to feel ownership in the program rather than like recipients of someone else’s ideas. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=871))
- Over time, the meetings themselves became a touchpoint in our peer education program because of their consistency in community life. ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=879))
- Second, along with customers, frontline staff are often the real experts. They provide insights into the potential for service design that are frequently as valuable to the project as insights from customers, and they can provide a perspective on the day-to-day experiences that managers and marketing people may never experience. ([Location 893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=893))
- In services, a more useful way to engage with people is by looking at different stages of their relationship with the service. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=905))
- What is most important to look for is variation in quality between the touchpoints and the gap between expectations and experiences. When people get what they expect, they feel that the quality is right. Whether it is a premium or a low-cost service, a minimal gap between expectation and experience means greater customer satisfaction. ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=923))
- Thus, it is important to be strategic and decide on the scope of your insights research. ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=929))
- The goal is usable insight that will improve the quality of the service design projects you are working on. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=950))
- These interviews are usually guided by a theme, and they provide an opportunity to explore relevant issues in depth with participants, query and verify what they say, and achieve consensus on what they mean. ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=995))
- Interviewing Consumers in Pairs For some people, a one-to-one interview can feel imposing and exposing, although a good interviewer should be able to put them at ease quickly. ([Location 1027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1027))
- if you are asking people to talk openly about their feelings about their job, then B2B interviews may be better conducted in a neutral environment, such as a coffee shop. ([Location 1052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1052))
- Participation—Becoming the User ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1117))
- Preparing for Participation Here are a few specific tips to bear in mind when planning to use the participation method. Be open: You may have to do things you haven’t done before; it is important to be open and embrace them. You want to avoid distracting the people you are studying by having them look after you. Be organized: Good planning is essential. You are about to wade into someone else’s workspace and workflow. You are also likely to be representing your client to the public or your client’s customers. Treat what you are doing with the same respect you would show any real job. ([Location 1132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1132))
- Probes are task-based insights activities that are good for generating insights with minimum influence from the researcher and bringing out views in quieter participants (Figure 4.7). These are more formally called cultural probes, as developed by Bill Gaver of the Royal College of Art. ([Location 1193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1193))
- Plenty of examples of cultural probes and other interview aids can be found online and in the literature. Consider them as tools for your research toolbox and add to your collection as you come across or develop more over the years. Roberta Tassi’s Service Design Tools website (www.servicedesigntools.org) is a great place to share them, too. ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1201))
- Try lining up less “important” interviews earlier on, such as people not really in your target group or friends who would not mind repeating the interview if necessary. This helps you practice your interview routine before you get to the CEO or the expert who only has a 30-minute time window for you. ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1305))
- Insights Boards Insights boards can be used to present insights based on real people who have been interviewed as an alternative to using fabricated personas. It is important to include photographs on each board to help people relate to the participant. ([Location 1384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1384))
- The most common lost opportunity is when enterprises neglect the resource that customers can be in terms of providing value back to the service. Customers are usually motivated to provide labor, knowledge, and data if these will help them get a better result, and when customers invest in the outcome, they connect more strongly to the brand. ([Location 1463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1463))
- Products require designers to deal with many moving parts, but services require us to design systems that adapt well to constantly changing parts. Networks, organizations, and technology evolve ([Location 1533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1533))
- It is much easier to focus design effort on the boxes because they represent tangible touchpoints—the website, the ticket machine, and so on—but most people forget to think about designing the experience of the arrows, which are the transitions from one touchpoint to the next. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1545))
    - topic:: [[orange\|orange]] 
- All experiences of a service are a result of interactions of some kind. Obvious interactions are various touchpoints such as objects, interfaces, and interpersonal interactions. ([Location 1556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1556))
    - topic:: [[orange\|orange]] 
- Service experiences are also affected by the contexts of time and place, and the most amazing thing at the wrong time can be more of a service design failure than something average that is delivered at exactly the right moment. Think of a romantic dinner interrupted by the restaurant violinist blaring away while a couple is trying to have a quiet conversation, or a helpful nurse arriving with a delicious meal just after a loved one has died. Some of the best service experiences are like the ideal wine waiter—there when he is needed, but somehow invisible when he is not. ([Location 1560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1560))
    - topic:: [[orange\|orange]] 
- The Web and mobile team can look at their touchpoints, design them well, take a strong UX approach, and argue their case, but are the silos really dissolved? ([Location 1572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1572))
    - topic:: [[orange\|orange]] 
- After a recent upgrade, the graphic design of the screens is much more pleasant, but the overall interaction flow is slower and therefore worse due to the extra animation and display overhead. In the context of a design studio, the flow makes some sense, but in the context of rushing for a train and needing to buy a ticket, it is a disaster. The other context is the business of the machines themselves, usually designed and maintained by third-party organizations. Even when it is clear to the designers and researchers that the ticket machines are a problem, the company supplying and maintaining those machines usually resists changes, citing IT support issues. ([Location 1621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1621))
    - topic:: [[orange\|orange]] 
- Shostack’s line of visibility has transmuted into the frontstage/backstage metaphor in which anything that the “customer” experiences is frontstage (on-stage would be more appropriate to the metaphor) and everything else that goes on behind the scenes to make that happen is backstage. ([Location 1656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1656))
- The project team must then align insights from backstage staff with customer needs and define where in the customer journey the experience breaks down or great opportunities exist. ([Location 1707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1707))
- situation. Feeding touchpoint insights into a blueprint gives us a basis from which to work so that we can improve a service. It also gives us an overview that helps us decide which touchpoints to focus on during prototyping. ([Location 1731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1731))
- The service proposition is essentially the business proposition, but seen from both the business and the customer/user perspective. It is important that some kind of business model lies behind the service—even if it is a free or public service—otherwise it will not be sustainable or resilient to change. ([Location 1913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=1913))
- Service designers need to align insights from backstage staff with customer needs. Define where the experience breaks down or great opportunities exist in the customer journey, where channels and technologies play well together to produce value, and when they run counter to each other. Taking journeys through the blueprint is a way to iron out many of these issues ([Location 2054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=2054))
- detailed phase or step summary document that describes what the user experience should be across all the channels at that stage of the journey (Figure 6.11). ([Location 2074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=2074))
- The experience was terrible but the medical outcome was excellent, and Ben and his wife know which they would prefer. In situations like this, a short-term bad experience is offset by long-term benefit or value. The real problem is in the management of the experience and expectations, and here is where service design can help iron out the kinks. ([Location 2154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=2154))
- Getting the experience right means gaining customer loyalty ([Location 2172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=2172))
- The fact that users are locked in to using a service is not a reason to neglect their experiences, but all the more reason to make sure they experience something positive and engaging because they cannot escape it. ([Location 2174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=2174))
- Although experiences are a crucial element to understand and consider in service design, they are one of a number of factors alongside economics, operations, and domain expertise. It is the combination of all of these that comprise the entire service proposition, with the service user as an organizing “common ground” around whom all aspects of the service can focus. ([Location 2183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=2183))
- As customers, we have expectations of a service in terms of quality and value that overarch the day-to-day tasks we undertake. These expectations are set by the brand and our experience of other services, and are closely tied to the amount we are paying. Consider budget airlines compared to premium air travel—the brand promise of each sets our service expectations. If our experience does not match our expectations, we are disappointed and become more likely to switch next time. ([Location 2223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=2223))
- To expand on our previous example, a nurse provides a service in at least two directions—to the patient and to the doctors. She may also provide services to the hospital administration and health insurance companies. At the same time, she is using internal hospital services (e.g., IT systems, catering, and security services), commercial laboratory services, and other sources of information (e.g., ambulance drivers, other nurses, literature, flyers, and databases). ([Location 2250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=2250))
- Most people experience this in longterm public services such as education or healthcare. When we interact with them, we feel there are tasks to be completed successfully, of course, but we also have a sense of the right to feel that there should be value in the delivery of these services because they impact who we are and our sense of ourselves. When teaching is reduced to cost savings on a per pupil basis, it misses the point of education. ([Location 2267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=2267))
    - topic:: [[blue\|blue]] 
- when you exceed expectations at a certain point, you have already set yourself up to disappoint at the next interaction if you cannot deliver at the same level. Sometimes, you may need to consider reducing the quality of a certain touchpoint to enhance the overall experience of quality in the service. ([Location 2298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=2298))

- The smallest expectation-experience mismatch with a touchpoint can ruin any overblown efforts to pump up the experience artificially. ([Location 2314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BI5O6DI&location=2314))
    - topic:: [[blue\|blue]]
