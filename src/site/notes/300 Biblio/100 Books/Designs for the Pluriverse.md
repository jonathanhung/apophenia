- design is central to the structures of unsustainability that hold in place the contemporary, so-called modern world. But despite crucial continuities, today’s social and design contexts are significantly different than in the 1970s ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6fadd04knyzf5gpwah91883))
- ubiquity of design—design is literally everywhere; from the largest structures to the humblest aspects of everyday life, modern lives are thoroughly designed lives. Second, social context is important for successful design, well beyond products’ functional or commercial applications, or for effective services. Third, ecologically oriented fields in particular have realized design’s vital role in creating a more livable world, with the concomitant need to come up with types of design that make a difference. The fourth signals what is perhaps the most radical change: the need to take seriously the notion that everybody designs, leading to a whole range of proposals for ethnographic, participatory, and collaborative design, and indeed a rethinking of the entire concept of design, “when everybody designs,” as Italian design theorist and practitioner Ezio Manzini (2015) pronounced in the very title of his most recent, and compelling, book ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6faf64rzqsbv7cfenfmvrrv))
- based on interactivity and user participation; design comes to be seen as collaborative, plural, participatory, and distributed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6faftm5e5teq817shcxxz30))
- What the notion of design signals in this work—despite design’s multiple and variegated meanings—is diverse forms of life and, often, contrasting notions of sociability and the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6fahkej6273syacxcmjr9vg))
- cultural studies approach to design ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6fahzka2c086zg33gsnxde7))
- Ontological design stems from a seemingly simple observation: that in designing tools (objects, structures, policies, expert systems, discourses, even narratives) we are creating ways of being ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6fap20gf2wb4aspbp67f5es))
- every community practices the design of itself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6faqcs2jbwc4ke763e2h61s))
- this chapter attempts to place autonomy and the communal at the center of design. (That this has nothing to do with the individual autonomy imagined by liberalism will become clear throughout the book. In fact, the opposite is the case.)

- Being a transition designer means adopting different values and perspectives. It is therefore a process of learning, but, for the same reason, a challenge. It requires designers to acknowledge the hypocrisy that comes from being a change agent toward a new system from within the old system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6fgw6bvdrrc2tvzycaj77d8))
- The first presents a range of transition visions that have been emerging with clarity and force in recent years, in both the Global North (e.g., degrowth, commoning, and the Transition Town Initiative) and the Global South (Buen Vivir, postdevelopment, transitions to postextractivism, and others ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6fgys03fhcnynaxk58y96h5))
- Embedded within the concept of collaborative life projects is therefore a critique of these central aspects of modernity; said otherwise, the concept takes seriously the anthropological insight that individual actions occur within meaning systems that are ineluctably historical and collective ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6fgsc2w0ytph9rcsd0qe24z))
- the key to autonomy is that a living system finds its way into the next moment by acting appropriately out of its own resources ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6fasqs2eq40twv4dmh26sfe))
