## Highlights 
---
- Contemporary society has lost touch with soul and the path to psychological and spiritual maturity, or true adulthood. Instead, we are encouraged to create lives of predictable security, false normality, material comfort, bland entertainment, and the illusion of eternal youth. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=481))
- We long to discover the secrets and mysteries of our individual lives, to find our unique way of belonging to this world, to recover the never-before-seen treasure we were born to bring to our communities. To carry this treasure to others is half of our spiritual longing. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=550))
- The nature-based people native to all continents know that to uncover the secrets of our souls, we must journey into the unknown, deep into the darkness of our selves and farther into an outer world of many dangers and uncertainties. They understand that no one would casually or gleefully choose such a thing. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=564))
- In contemporary Western cultures, we live as if the spiritual descent is no longer necessary; we live without realizing that the journey is meant for each one of us, not just for the heroes and heroines of mythology. ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=599))
- The soul, after all, is our inner wilderness, the intrapsychic terrain we know the least and that holds our individual mysteries. ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=654))
- Our society is forever erecting barriers between its citizens and the inner/outer wilderness. ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=658))
- Entry into the life of the soul — a life of passion, enchantment, and service — demands a steep price, a psychological form of dying. We do not easily give up our claim on the good life of extended adolescence, what Jungian analyst James Hollis refers to as our “first adulthood. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=737))
- Like the poet, I wanted to find out, not just about God but about what was uniquely meaningful and essential to me — what I would be willing to die for, and “how to melt into that fierce heat of living. ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=782))
- By soul I mean the vital, mysterious, and wild core of our individual selves, an essence unique to each person, qualities found in layers of the self much deeper than our personalities. By spirit I mean the single, great, and eternal mystery that permeates and animates everything in the universe and yet transcends all. Ultimately, each soul exists as an agent for spirit. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=812))
- Our core powers can be divided into our most central values, abilities, and knowledge. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=828))
- Your soul is transpersonal and other because it is deeper and far more expansive than your conscious mind. Your soul encompasses many qualities of which you are not yet aware and may never become aware, including qualities you may flatly deny. Your soul may desire, for example, that you sing your heart songs, or that you assist others through major life transitions, but maybe you don’t have a clue about this. Or, if you do have a clue, you might refuse that desire out of fear, a sense of unworthiness, or any number of other “good” reasons. As you delve into the mysteries of your soul, you discover your core powers and learn to integrate them into your daily choices and actions. ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=850))
- When a person encounters her individual soul, on the other hand, we are more likely to say she has uncovered her unique gifts, her destiny, her life purpose, or personal meaning. Through soul encounter, she learns why spirit and nature gave birth to the exceptional individual she is and about her particular way of belonging to the world. ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=918))
- Each human archetype consists of an identifiable pattern found in every society and, as a potential, within every human being: the Hero, the Wise and Gentle Queen, the Courageous Warrior, the Virtuous Maiden, the Seductress, the Nurturing Mother, the Holy Child, the Young Redeemer, the Rebel, the Tyrant, the Trickster, the Sacred Fool, the Innocent, the Sage, the Crone, the Magician. A given individual will resonate more with some patterns than others, or at a certain stage more with one archetype than another, but in any human community each archetype will be found embodied in someone. ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=925))
- an individual’s soul is a mosaic of themes from the universal archetypes. One person might embody the Hero and the Monk, while another resonates more with the Wise Old Man, the Fool, and the Trickster. Each individual is a unique collection of archetypes expressing a gestalt as individual as a snow crystal. ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=933))
- the twentieth-century depth psychologists Carl Jung, Marie-Louise von Franz, James Hillman, Marion Woodman, Robert Johnson, James Hollis, and others. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=938))
- The middle realm of ego growth includes the healing of emotional wounds, the development of personal bonds, the cultivation of physical grace and emotional expression, and the blossoming of empathy, intimacy, and personality-level authenticity. ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=948))
- The second realm of development, the underworld of soul embodiment, deepens individuality through the discovery of our particular place in the world and the embodiment of our unique form of service. Soul embodiment is facilitated by practices that I refer to collectively as soulcraft and that include underworld dreamwork and deep imagery journeys, ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=955))
- Although all three components can be engaged concurrently, there is a natural sequence to their unfolding: ego growth is the foundation upon which soul embodiment rests, and the latter, I believe, most effectively galvanizes spirit realization. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1015))

- The initial goal of the descent is to cultivate the relationship between the ego and the soul, and that is underworld business, business that might, at first, make our surface lives more difficult or lonely, or less comfortable, secure, or happy. Soulcraft practices prepare the ego to abandon its social stability and psychological composure and to be reassigned as an active, adult agent for soul, as opposed to its former role as an adolescent agent for itself. Psychotherapy aims for enhanced coping and social adjustment, and soulcraft for initiation and cultural change. Soulcraft can be counter-therapeutic. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1026))

- psychotherapy can interfere with soulcraft. To move closer to soul, a person might need to leave a relationship, job, home, or role. Some therapists might discourage such ([Location 1038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1038))

- A mature ego understands the occasional necessity of surrendering to — or being defeated by — a force greater than itself, sometimes during the death-rebirth of soul encounter (when ego surrenders to soul) and other times during ego transcendence (when ego surrenders to spirit). ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1095))
- A VISION WITH A TASK Each of us is born with a treasure, an essence, a seed of quiescent potential, secreted for safekeeping in the center of our being. This treasure, this personal quality, power, talent, or gift (or set of such qualities), is ours to develop, embody, and offer to our communities through acts of service — our contributions to a more diverse, vital, and evolved world. Our personal destiny is to become that treasure through our actions. Wisdomways throughout the world agree that life’s greatest fulfillment sprouts from our sacred work, deeds embodying our soul treasures. Our sacred work is what nature-based traditions call our giveaway to our people and place. The giveaway bridges the opposition between selfishness and altruism. We cannot experience soul fulfillment without performing true service, and vice versa. The theologian Frederick Buechner said this in an elegant way: “our calling is where our deepest gladness and the world’s hunger meet.”20 Psychologist Abraham Maslow makes the same point in describing people who are psychologically and spiritually healthiest: Self-actualizing people are, without one single exception, involved in a cause outside their own skins, in something outside themselves. They are devoted, working at something, something which is very precious to them—some calling or vocation in the old sense, the priestly sense. They are working at something which fate has called them to somehow and which they work at and which they love, so that the work-joy dichotomy in them disappears. ([Location 1099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1099))
- What I must do merges with what I want to do; work and play become indistinguishable. Even in Western society, our deepest yearnings go far beyond a vacation or retirement. We long for a vision of our destiny, and, equally, for a way to carry that vision as a gift to others. The following lines, attributed to sources as diverse as Chief Seattle, Winston Churchill, ([Location 1119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1119))
- You, too, can reclaim your membership as a natural being in a natural world. The easiest and most direct way to begin is to simply spend time outdoors, quietly, observantly, and gratefully. By innocently immersing yourself in nature, you will discover, in time, that nature reflects your soul, revealing your particular place in the more-than-human world. ([Location 1138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1138))
- Wild nature contains all the terrestrial patterns of belonging. Every niche of the world is filled with a life-form that perfectly fits there because it was born to do just that. The wilder the environment (the more complex and diverse it is), and the more likely it contains patterns of belonging that resonate with your destiny. No matter who you are, no matter what possibilities you contain, there are forms and forces in wild nature that will reflect the nuances of your soul. ([Location 1145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1145))
- Perhaps now you feel a call, like the trees’ ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1219))
- The call comes when it’s time to inherit a greater life, to plunge yourself into the limitless expanse and depth the world affords. This is both a crisis and an unsurpassed opportunity. The old way of life has been outgrown. The familiar goals, attitudes, and patterns of relationships no longer fit your developing sense of who you truly are. The time has arrived to step over a threshold into a whole new way of being. ([Location 1236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1236))
- After years of raising a family and/or building a career, we begin to ask again what is most essential. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1242))
- will have to relinquish your temptation to conform or to seek acceptance from others. You will have to go out on your own. You will have to move beyond any requirement to be “good,” any obligation to be held back by shame about who you are. ([Location 1281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1281))
- The greatest value to be derived from building that first house comes from the building of it — not from the living in it. ([Location 1297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1297))
- Why an immense loneliness? In surrendering the mainstays of your former worldview and separating yourself from everyday community life, your old anchors and familiar reference points disappear. ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1301))
- Leaving your summer house, however, does not mean you must betray your preexisting responsibilities. It doesn’t necessarily require you to quit your job, sell your house, leave your marriage, or end friendships. It can be done without abandoning your children. Most parents recognize their commitment to their children as sacred as their commitment to their own souls. Although the descent for a parent may be logistically different, perhaps more challenging, than it is for others, it can still be accomplished. ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1306))
- What leaving your summer house does require is that you surrender what no longer supports your exploration of your deepest nature. You will discover soon enough which roles, relationships, activities, and possessions get in the way of that exploration: you are being asked to radically simplify your life. ([Location 1310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1310))
- The world was made to be free in: this we know in our bones, and this definitive and fearful knowledge is what both supports us and requires us to turn away from our secure but less-than-joyful lives. ([Location 1327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1327))
- First, if it is a true call, you will know that responding to it is, in fact, not an avoidance of responsibility, but rather a facing of something difficult, something unknown and frightening that summons you. Far from looking to you like an opportunity for escape, a call feels more like a compelling need to walk into the mouth of a whale, or out into the night and into a storm. ([Location 1405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1405))
- this strange thing that calls to you somehow ([Location 1409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1409))
- feels “profoundly familiar to the unconscious—though unknown, surprising, and even frightening to the conscious personality.” ([Location 1410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1410))
- She senses what is possible as well as actual. She sees into people and places and possibilities, and she cultivates a relationship with the invisible realms as much as with the visible. She is in conversation with the mysteries of the world, on the lookout for signs and omens. She attends especially to the edges, those places where one thing merges with another, where consciousness shifts ([Location 1582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1582))
- But now, years later, having secured a good place in the village world, she strikes out on her own in search of her lost soul. ([Location 1598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1598))
- In the second cocoon of life, the transformation we seek is as mysterious and as momentous — from an individual whose goal is to improve his social and/or economic standing to one whose primary motivation is to turn his soul’s vision into reality. ([Location 1630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1630))
- But the wild earth is not the only substance with which the Wanderer weaves his cocoon. Other strands might include his solitude, his deepest wounds from childhood, karma from previous lifetimes, his dreams, his mortality, ceremonies, the dark, and his own shadow — all woven together to form an alchemical cauldron of change. ([Location 1636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1636))
- Her authentic place is not simply one that someone will pay her to occupy (like a job), nor a task she happens to have the talent to perform (like an art or a craft), nor a career a vocational counselor recommends for her (like banking or social work), nor a social role (like caregiver, student, parent, servant, leader, whore, or rebel) in which other people will accept her. It’s got to be her place, one in keeping with her vital core. ([Location 1684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1684))
- In Oliver’s poem, the journeyer is “determined to save/the only life [she] could save.” This is not a recommendation for selfishness. The journeyer identifies this savable life only by “[striding] deeper and deeper into the world,” and in so doing, she finds the place in which her life and the life of the world are one; she finds the place where, as Frederick Buechner says, “our deepest gladness and the world’s hunger meet.” The life she saves is what Campbell calls “the core of us . . . the basic character of our being,” which leads to a life of joyful service to the world. This salvation is an act of love, love of both self and world. ([Location 1701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1701))
- As with the doorways of death and birth, you journey alone through strange and unfamiliar realms on your way to a soulful or second adulthood. You must learn to conduct yourself boldly and to make difficult and critical choices without the comforting presence of a life partner, guide, or teacher at your side. You must sharpen your skills of physical, social, psychological, and spiritual self-reliance. There are some skills you are undoubtedly lacking and that you’ll soon need if you are going to truly wander, skills that may never have been necessary if you had planned on “staying home” your whole life. ([Location 1763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1763))
- Greg, a successful health care professional, had a satisfying life but knew he could offer himself more imaginatively to the world. Writing fiction had been his primary creative outlet, but for several years he had rarely been inspired to write. In his desk drawer sat a stack of mostly unfinished short stories and the beginnings of a novel. He began to doubt he had anything original to say. One day Greg had a sudden recognition of what he needed to do. Waves of grief and fear shook his body like a fever. He went to his study and pulled every page from his desk, lit a fire in his woodstove, and burned them all. Then he deleted every associated computer file. As if appeasing a god, he made a sacrifice of all his creations, somehow recognizing this to be a necessary step toward authentic expression. Then he opened the door of his house and went for a run, leaving behind his dreams of being a writer. An odd mixture of feelings overtook him — grief, blithe disbelief in what he had done . . . and relief. He ran. ([Location 1807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1807))
- This is precisely the sort of courage and action required of the Wanderer: to sacrifice his dependence upon old forms and routines derived from other hearts and minds, to learn to rely on a deeper identity. ([Location 1820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1820))
- Once you have your survival dance established, you can wander, inwardly and outwardly, searching for clues to your sacred dance, the work you were born to do. This work may have no relation to your job. Your sacred dance sparks your greatest fulfillment and extends your truest service to others. ([Location 1828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1828))
- Leaving home means divesting the provisional identity you developed in adolescence and have been refining (or not) ever since. Regardless of your age, if you have not yet embarked upon the underworld journey, you are still operating from that adolescent identity and its social roles, no matter how polished they may have become. An adolescent or first-adulthood identity is primarily focused upon social standing, psychological security, interpersonal and physical comfort, wealth, fame, and/or the sort of personal power that is power over rather than power with. A soul-rooted identity, in contrast, is primarily focused upon the discovery of and joyous offering of the gift of soul to the world. ([Location 1844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1844))
- What is important in the second cocoon, especially at its beginning, is to complete those pieces of old business that otherwise would keep you imprisoned in your former identity. ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1860))
- Before enrolling in any soulcraft program, I recommend to ([Location 1924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1924))
- substance addicts a minimum of one month of abstinence (along with therapy and/or a twelve-step group). It’s simply not possible to open to the mysteries of the inner or outer worlds when you are numbed out and/or craving your next fix. Many have participated in soulcraft ([Location 1924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1924))
- Each of us has a Loyal Soldier sub-personality, a courageous, creative, and stubborn entity formed when we needed somewhat drastic measures to survive the realities (sometimes dysfunctional) of childhood. ([Location 1967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1967))
- Common Loyal Soldier survival strategies include harsh self-criticism (to make us — the ego — feel unworthy and thus ineligible for Wild Child actions that might bring further punishment, abandonment, or criticism); placing our personal agenda last (so as to not displease or arouse anger or envy); other codependent behaviors (e.g., caretaking, rescuing, enabling) to stave off abandonment; pleasing but immature and inauthentic personas; partial or complete social withdrawal (to minimize hurtful contacts); adopting an unpleasant or downtrodden appearance (to protect us from criticism); restricting our range of feeling by encouraging us to always be in charge, busy, angry, ruthless, withdrawn, and/or numb; and suppressing our intelligence, talent, enthusiasm, sensuality, and wildness by locking up these qualities in an inaccessible corner of our psyches. ([Location 1974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1974))
- So what to do? It’s neither possible nor advisable to suppress him or get rid of him! Instead, use the successful approach the Japanese people took with their loyal soldiers: They (1) loved them and welcomed them home as heroes; (2) thanked them a thousand times, deeply and sincerely, for their loyalty, courage, and service; (3) told them, gently, over and over again, that the war was over; and (4) when they were ready, helped them find new societal roles for employing their considerable talents. ([Location 1997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=1997))
- It helps immensely if your Nurturing Parent can be specific with your Loyal Soldier about the exact war conditions of your childhood and why you are no longer subject to them. Patiently describe the specific emotional conditions, your family relationships, and the emotional wounds endured. Then identify for him, specifically and in detail, the resources for loving and for engendering love you now possess. ([Location 2018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=2018))
- LEARNING TO CHOOSE AUTHENTICITY OVER SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE As a Wanderer, you must be true to yourself. You cannot continue to follow the crowd. Prior to the second cocoon, you learned the basics of authenticity. Within the bounds of what your Loyal Soldier would permit, you learned to distinguish what is true about yourself from what is not, gradually becoming clearer about your genuine attitudes, interests, styles, desires, values, and emotions. You learned you could act in accordance with, ([Location 2137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=2137))
- Now, in the second cocoon, you must take up the practice of reversing the priority between acceptance and authenticity. Authenticity and integrity become your foundations for asking the deeper questions of soul. ([Location 2148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=2148))
- Shallow loyalty is ultimately selfish if your goal is to increase your acceptance or socioeconomic security through compliance. ([Location 2160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=2160))
- comply. Supporting a person’s weakness, psychopathology, or addiction is always a case of shallow loyalty, otherwise known as enabling, caretaking, or codependency. ([Location 2163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=2163))
- conformity. Although she left the home of her adolescent identity and religious affiliation, Nan didn’t leave her marriage or children — and didn’t need to. She began peeling away layers of social conditioning to ground herself in a more authentic life. She completed her graduate degree and developed friendships outside the church, with friends that supported the person she was discovering herself to be. She asked herself regularly, “Who am I at my core? What is my relationship to God? ([Location 2185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=2185))
- Arne Naess calls the “ecological self” or what James Hillman calls “a psyche the size of the earth ([Location 2407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=2407))
- Soul initiation transforms our lives by the power of the truth at the center of our soul image. Embracing that truth results in a radical simplification of our lives. Activities and relationships not supportive of our soul purpose begin to fall away. Our former agendas are discarded, half-completed projects abandoned. Many old problems are not solved but outgrown. Old ways of presenting and defending ourselves become less appealing, and less necessary. ([Location 2450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=2450))
- deep imagery guide is like a wilderness outfitter, someone you hire to take you into a desert, forest, or mountain range. Your guide is familiar with the opportunities and dangers of the inner wilderness and knows how to interact respectfully with the wildlife; but it’s your choice where you’ll go in that wilderness and how long you’ll stay. The guide helps with the logistics of the journey and makes suggestions as to how to handle what arises. Yet, once the journey begins, both of ([Location 2846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=2846))
- For many Westerners, use of the imagination is an unfamiliar skill. Some people have great difficulty, at first, accessing their deep images; they may have spent too much of their lives relying on thinking, or perhaps were taught as children that imagination was dangerous, bad, or foolish. Other people, as they begin again to imagine, become concerned they are “just making it up.” They ask, “How do I know this is real or valid? Am I doing this right? ([Location 2925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=2925))
- So little of our conversation addresses our passions, loves, emotions, dreams, or our creative insights and soul stirrings. ([Location 3039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=3039))
- a poem, grief, yearning, joy, your eloquence, a song, a dance, a lock of hair, praise, tobacco, water. Early on, cross over a physical threshold (such as a stream, a stick, a large rock, a passageway between two trees) to mark your transition from ordinary time and space to the sacred. While on the sacred side, observe three cross-cultural taboos: do not eat, do not speak with other humans, and do not enter any human-made shelter. Wander aimlessly until you feel called by something that draws your attention, by way of an attraction, a curiosity, an allurement, a repulsion, a fear. ([Location 3205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=3205))
- A mystery may or may not arrive, but should we be so graced, its form will surely surprise. It is best to be humble and not expect something majestic, for then we would probably miss what does arrive. ([Location 3973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=3973))
- At times of major life transitions, when vision fasts are usually undertaken, our self-definitions no longer fit or provide enough meaning or passion for living. Yet we are stuck in those definitions like an outgrown set of clothes. Our egos, in their current form, have become an impediment to growth and fulfillment instead of the vehicle for soul embodiment they ideally are. You might say management has become an enemy of soul progress. At times like this, we need to shake up the management team by way of the underworld journey. This is ego-destructuring, experienced by the ego as a dying. As ego-destructuring gets underway, the ego becomes terrified and may try to stop the process — even when the ego itself has chosen it. Signing up for soul encounter can be like getting on a roller coaster and then thinking better of it as you are towed up the initial incline. What’s at risk is your entire way of belonging to the world. ([Location 4141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=4141))

- The lament expresses, in essence, that the quester has lost his way, has strayed off his path of heart, or has gone as far as he could with what he knows. Perhaps it admits that the adolescent personality cannot take him further, and that this recognition and loss are difficult and painful, an ordeal. For the modern vision quester, the lament may sound something like this: “Dear God! Help me! I can no longer find my way in the world by figuring it out. My old way doesn’t provide enough meaning to go on living! I seek a way to help my people, to offer something good to the world. I see people suffering everywhere around me; the animals, the waters, and the land itself are suffering. I long for a vision, a gift to bring back to my community. I release my former understanding of self and world. I am willing to sacrifice everything — my social position, my belongings, my home; they mean nothing without vision. I lament and go without food. I dwell alone beneath the sky. O, God! Help me!” ([Location 4175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=4175))
- As David Whyte notes, we feel our lack before we feel our longing. ([Location 4183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=4183))
- Your lament, once begun in earnest, gathers emotional momentum; it opens your eyes wide to the world as it opens your heart to your deepest longing. The longing forges a vessel capable of receiving a vision. ([Location 4185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001H0PDLS&location=4185))
