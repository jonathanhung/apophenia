## Highlights

- We were all raised in what I’ll call the mono-mind belief system—the idea that you have one mind, out of which different thoughts and emotions and impulses and urges emanate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5z2evgbfa4bafzg52wn7xeq))
- In other words, all of us are born with many sub-minds that are constantly interacting inside of us. This is in general what we call *thinking*, because the parts are talking to each other and to you constantly about things you have to do or debating the best course of action, and so on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5z2ff82ft4a8fc0q2eqm7f8))
- The emphasis on willpower and self-control permeates American culture. We think we should be able to discipline our primitive, impulsive, sinful minds through willpower. Countless self-help books tell us it’s all a matter of boosting our ability to control ourselves and develop more discipline. The concept of willpower, too, has historical roots—namely in the Victorian Era with its Christian emphasis on resisting evil impulses. The idea of taking responsibility for oneself and not making excuses is as American as apple pie. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5z2hx49x4mwbhgmvypkdq93))
- we learn at an early age to shame and manhandle our unruly parts. We simply wrestle them into submission. One part is recruited by this cultural imperative to become our inner drill sergeant and often becomes that nasty inner critic we love to hate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5z2je9rpn4hsk8s05btasvs))
- We often find that the harder we try to get rid of emotions and thoughts, the stronger they become. This is because parts, like people, fight back against being shamed or exiled. And if we do succeed in dominating them with punitive self-discipline, we then become tyrannized by the rigid, controlling inner drill sergeant. We might be disciplined, but we’re not much fun. And because the exiled (bingeing, raging, hypersexual, etc.) parts will seize any momentary weakness to break out again and take over, we have to constantly be on guard against any people or situations that might trigger those parts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5z2mknvk9s739zptdrgefcq))
- any approach that increases your inner drill sergeant’s impulse to shame you into behaving (and make you feel like a failure if you can’t) will do no better in internal families than it does in external ones in which parents adopt shaming tactics to control their children. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5z2p434r0j46v0qwkm3mhg5))
- Since most psychotherapies and spiritual practices subscribe to this mono-mind view, their solutions often reinforce this approach by suggesting we should correct irrational beliefs or meditate them away, because those beliefs are seen as obstacles emanating from our one mind. Many approaches to meditation, for example, view thoughts as pests and the ego as a hindrance or annoyance, and practitioners are given instructions to either ignore or transcend them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5z2rmwj6cnf471wvqtvam7j))
    - Note: not asking to engage with the mind's thoughts but not to ignore them either. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- The collection of parts that these traditions call the ego are protectors who are simply trying to keep us safe and are reacting to and containing other parts that carry emotions and memories from past traumas that we have locked away inside. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5z2whm2sbrj0vajz79sn0hj))
- I told the part that it made total sense that it had to do that to save the woman’s life in the past, but why did it still have to cut her now? It spoke of having to protect other highly vulnerable parts of her and it had to control the rage that was still there. As it talked about all of that, it became clear to me that the cutting part wasn’t living in the present. It seemed frozen in those abuse scenes and believed that my client was still a child and in grave danger, even though she wasn’t anymore ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h64y0sttec4vt5cc113hggh6))
    - Note: Parts exist as protecting q previous vulnerable sett. Asking the question what is this part protecting me from? [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- When I asked these protective parts what they’d rather do if they trusted they didn’t have to protect, they often wanted to do something opposite of the role they were in. Inner critics wanted to become cheerleaders or sage advisors, extreme caretakers wanted to help set boundaries, rageful parts wanted to help with discerning who was safe. It seemed that not only were parts not what they seemed, but also they each had qualities and resources to bring to the client’s life that were not available while they were tied up in the protective roles ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h64y4yphcba5d7dba87p6ah5))
- this is how parts describe themselves—that they have bodies and that their bodies contain emotions and beliefs that came into them and don’t belong to them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7t50ms270pgygmahyp4tp5j))

- When we are young, we have little discernment regarding the validity of these emotions and beliefs and, consequently, they get lodged in the bodies of our young parts and become powerful (albeit unconscious) organizers of our lives thereafter. These we call *personal burdens* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7t55hm72qvcpgyf37gp305k))
- the most powerful personal burdens are similar to what attachment theory pioneer John Bowlby called *internal working models*.[11](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/73443701#ch1fn-11) He saw them as maps you developed as a child of what to expect from your caretaker and the world in general, and then from subsequent close relationships. They also tell you things about your own level of goodness and how much you deserve love and support ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7t573nd7ywwvmeegbs2cdj9))
- If, on the other hand, you believe that the part that seeks drugs is protective and carries the burden of responsibility for keeping this person from severe emotional pain or even suicide, then you would treat the person very differently. You could instead help them get to know that part and honor it for its attempts to keep them going and negotiate permission to heal or change what it protects.
  It’s as if each part is like a person with a true purpose.
  Then you would help the person heal by returning to the now liberated “addict” part and help it unburden all its fear and responsibility. *Unburdening* is another aspect of IFS that seems spiritual, because as soon as the burdens leave parts’ bodies, parts immediately transform into their original, valuable states. It’s as if a curse was lifted from an inner Sleeping Beauty, or ogre, or addict. The newly unburdened part almost universally says it feels much lighter and wants to play or rest, after which it finds a new role. The former addict part now wants to help you connect with people. The hypervigilant part becomes an advisor on boundaries. The critic becomes an inner cheerleader, and so on ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7t5ect6kd2qnjxs7emgdvc3))
    - Note: Parts are not their burdens, they serve a function that freeing them from a burden can illuminate. For example a part that feels shame protects so you can be loved. A part that criticizies can be liberated to cheer lead [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Thus, the kick in molesting a child came from being able to hurt and have power over someone weak and innocent. These perpetrator parts would do the same thing in their psyches to their own vulnerable, childlike parts. This process—in which protectors in one generation take on the perpetrator burdens of their parents while they were being abused by those parents—is one way that legacy burdens are transferred ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7t5n6we32sr0rxea0pzkkcg))
- Gestalt therapy involving multiple chairs. Basically, a client sits in one chair and talks to an empty chair across from them, and for IFS I had them imagine that the part they were talking to was in that empty chair. And because the parts got to speak, too, there was a lot of hopping back and forth, and to make it all work I ended up with an office full of chairs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7t5q11pvzrsvs85dn75n854))
- I can say with certainty that the Self is in everybody. Furthermore, the Self cannot be damaged, the Self doesn’t have to develop, and the Self possesses its own wisdom about how to heal internal as well as external relationships.
  For me, this is the most significant discovery that I stumbled onto. This is what changes everything. The Self is just beneath the surface of our protective parts, such that when they open space for it, it comes forward spontaneously, often quite suddenly, and universally.

- you may have noticed that by simply focusing on one of your parts, you were separating (*unblending*) from it. In other words, suddenly there was a *you* who was observing and an *it* that was being observed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7t6m6921zn5a4qczh8yhmjw))
