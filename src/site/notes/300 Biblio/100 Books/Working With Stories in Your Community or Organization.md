## Highlights

- Personally, I dislike the term because it implies that the “best” is rooted in the practice and not in the practitioner. I feel like the phrase privileges codification of knowledge over the emergent and constantly-co-evolving aspects of knowledge. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=176))
- An example of a project that helps people make decisions might be one that presents stories representing three different possible futures of a town, and asks townspeople to answer questions about their reactions to the stories and respond with stories of their own. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=227))
- Help people learn Telling stories to help people understand complex topics is both an ancient practice and an innate capacity. Providing a means to collect, provide context for, organize, and make available such learning stories can help a community become more collectively productive. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=240))
- Is this a problem? I don’t think so. I have come to believe that when your subject is human beings and the things they feel and believe, proof isn’t a very useful thing. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=257))
- I believe that the number of personal stories told in natural, everyday, casual conversation by any random person in any industrialized country today is likely to be smaller than at any time in the past, reaching back tens of thousands of years. If ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=271))
- Many factors have come together to create this change in the narrative life of families and communities: the time-stealing mass media, the whirrs of our various labor-saving devices, the loss of leisure time, the two-earner household, and the rise of commercially super-sized stories that make our own tales of daily life seem unworthy of attention. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=274))
- The fact is, we need to reskill ourselves in story exchange. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=278))
- share concepts and ideas in common with many other methods of participatory work. Pick up any book about participatory action research, community therapy, participatory theatre, or decision support, and you will find parallels to what you read here. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=296))
- Stories for negotiation ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=304))
- mechanism for the ritualized negotiation of truths. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=306))
- understand feelings and beliefs. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=308))
- triggers a different social response. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=311))
- story is a socially accepted package in which people have learned from a young age to wrap up their feelings, beliefs, and opinions. When they tell and listen to stories, people often reveal things about their feelings or opinions on a subject that they wouldn’t have been willing or able to reveal when talking about the topic directly. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=317))
- Asking people to tell stories shows respect by legitimizing their experiences as valuable communications. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=324))
- Articulation. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=340))
- Imagination. When a topic is complex and many-layered, the best course is to increase diversity, generate many ideas, think out of the box, and prepare for surprise. Asking a diverse range of people to tell you what they have done and seen enlists their imagination along with your own. This both broadens the net of exploration (by opening the inquiry to the varieties of human experience) and increases its flexibility (by capturing multidimensional content which can be plumbed again and again as needs emerge). ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=351))
- stories convey complex emotions with more ground truth than any other means of communication. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=358))
- Contextual richness. When you ask direct questions, it is easy to guess wrongly about what sorts of answers people might have and even about what sorts of questions might lead to useful answers. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=362))
- three essential dimensions of story ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=553))
- Story function is like the cell membrane: both are engaged in negotiating the interface between what lies within (events, processes) and what lies without (connection, meaning). ([Location 653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=653))
- If you live and breathe cognitive science, why not read Augusto Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed? If you dream in community therapy, why not pick up a book on screenwriting? If you design perfect characters, why not read up on expert systems or indigenous knowledge? ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=707))
- Uncertainty is the reason stories draw us in and engage us, because they tap into problem-solving instincts that have evolved over millions of years. ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=736))
- Because emotions are our pilots. Reason might keep the machine operating, but without emotions we have nowhere to go. ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=756))
- We use stories to chart maps of the world of our experiences. Sharing stories helps us validate and improve each other’s maps. We use stories to sound the terrain around us with evidential reasoning, enhancing our maps with additional dimensions. We use stories to tour important locations on our maps, entering into serious play that transports us without danger and develops our understanding of difficult terrain. We use stories to package the information on our maps, reducing cognitive overhead in well-known areas and freeing up resources to explore where exploration is needed most. ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=803))
- emotional, social, political, spiritual. From childhood on we build maps of the world we experience. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=811))
- Why pay so much attention to the edges? Because telling stories takes time and energy, and only at the edges is it worth the expense. Exploring the well-known simply does not pay off. ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=836))
- Play constitutes a first decoupling of the real, detaching aggression or any other “serious” behavior from its painful consequences so as to explore and master the possibilities of attack and defense. ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KMH208G&location=942))
