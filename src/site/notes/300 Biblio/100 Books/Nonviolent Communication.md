- Nonviolence is about inculcating positive attitudes to replace the negative attitudes that dominate us. Everything that we do is conditioned by selfish motives— what’s in it for me. More so in an overwhelmingly materialistic society that thrives on rugged individualism. None of these negative concepts are conducive to building a homogeneous family, community, society, or nation.

- NVC guides us in reframing how we express ourselves and hear others. Instead of habitual, automatic reactions, our words become conscious responses based firmly on awareness of what we are perceiving, feeling, and wanting. We are led to express ourselves with honesty and clarity, while simultaneously paying others a respectful and empathic attention. In any exchange, we come to hear our own deeper needs and those of others. NVC trains us to observe carefully, and to be able to specify behaviors and conditions that are affecting us. We learn to identify and clearly articulate what we are concretely wanting in any given situation. The form is simple, yet powerfully transformative. As NVC replaces our old patterns of defending, withdrawing, or attacking in the face of judgment and criticism, we come to perceive ourselves and others, as well as our intentions and relationships, in a new light. Resistance, defensiveness, and violent reactions are minimized. When we focus on clarifying what is being observed, felt, and needed rather than on diagnosing and judging, we discover the depth of our own compassion.

- me listening for the feeling and need behind each statement. I didn’t agree or disagree. I received his words, not as attacks, but as gifts from a fellow human willing to share his soul ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=520))
- It is my belief that all such analyses of other human beings are tragic expressions of our own values and needs. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=550))
- We all pay dearly when people respond to our values and needs not out of a desire to give from the heart, but out of fear, guilt, or shame. Sooner or later, we will experience the consequences of diminished goodwill on the part of those who comply with our values out of a sense of either external or internal coercion. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=554))
- We deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to factors outside ourselves: ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=605))
- The concept that certain actions merit reward while others merit punishment is also associated with life-alienating communication. ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=651))
- Our language is an imperfect instrument created by ancient and ignorant men. It is an animistic language that invites us to talk about stability and constants, about similarities and normal and kinds, about magical transformations, quick cures, simple problems, and final solutions. Yet the world we try to symbolize with this language is a world of process, change, differences, dimensions, functions, relationships, growths, interactions, developing, learning, coping, complexity. And the mismatch of our ever-changing world and our relatively static language forms is part of our problem. ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=701))
- 1. Use of verb to be without indication that the evaluator takes responsibility for the evaluation You are too generous. When I see you give all your lunch money to others, I think you are being too generous. 2. Use of verbs with evaluative connotations Doug procrastinates. Doug only studies for exams the night before. 3. Implication that one’s inferences about another person’s thoughts, feelings, intentions, or desires are the only ones possible She won’t get her work in. I don’t think she’ll get her work in. or She said, “I won’t get my work in.” ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=777))
- At an NVC workshop, a college student spoke about being kept awake by a roommate who played the stereo late at night and loudly. When asked to express what he felt when this happened, the student replied, “I feel that it isn’t right to play music so loud at night.” I pointed out that when he followed the word feel with the word that, he was expressing an opinion but not revealing his feelings. Asked to try again to express his feelings, he responded, “I feel, when people do something like that, it’s a personality disturbance.” ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=889))
- general, feelings are not being clearly expressed when the word feel is followed by: 1. Words such as that, like, as if: “I feel that you should know better.” “I feel like a failure.” “I feel as ifI’m living with a wall.” 2. The pronouns I, you, he, she, they, it: “I feel I am constantly on call.” “I feel it is useless.” 3. Names or nouns referring to people: “I feel Amy has been pretty responsible.” “I feel my boss is being manipulative.” ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=943))
- We see that our feelings result from how we choose to receive what others say and do, as well as from our particular needs and expectations in that moment. ([Location 1098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=1098))
- We make clear that we’re not testing their listening skills, but checking out whether we’ve expressed ourselves clearly. ([Location 1531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=1531))
- The objective of NVC is to establish a relationship based on honesty and empathy. When others trust that our primary commitment is to the quality of the relationship, and that we expect this process to fulfill everyone’s needs, then they can trust that our requests are true requests and not camouflaged demands.

- When we are thinking about people’s words and listening to how they connect to our theories, we are looking at people—we are not with them. ([Location 1814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=1814))
- When ([Location 1905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=1905))
- “Don’t pull any of that psychology crap on me!” we may be told. Should this occur, we continue our effort to sense the speaker’s feelings and needs; perhaps we see in this case that the speaker doesn’t trust our motives and needs more understanding of our intentions before he can appreciate hearing our paraphrases. As we’ve seen, all criticism, attack, insults, and judgments vanish when we focus attention on hearing the feelings and needs behind a message.

- I’d like change to be stimulated by a clear desire to enrich life for ourselves or for others rather than by destructive energies such as shame or guilt. ([Location 2367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=2367))
- I earnestly believe, however, that an important form of self-compassion is to make choices motivated purely by our desire to contribute to life rather than out of fear, guilt, shame, duty, or obligation. When we are conscious of the life-enriching purpose behind an action we take, when the sole energy that motivates us is simply to make life wonderful for others and ourselves, then even hard work has an element of play in it. ([Location 2447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0019O6IWU&location=2447))
- The most crucial application of NVC may be in the way we treat ourselves. When we make mistakes, instead of getting caught up in moralistic self-judgments, we can use the process of NVC mourning and self-forgiveness to show us where we can grow.
