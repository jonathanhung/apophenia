They help children learn to be members of a unique People, community, and place. Core values, traditions, livelihood, and a meaningful way of life are transferred, shared, and reinforced into the future. Indigenous people have built and sustained our communities by these means—teaching, learning, playing, and sharing stories and experiences—over millennia.
