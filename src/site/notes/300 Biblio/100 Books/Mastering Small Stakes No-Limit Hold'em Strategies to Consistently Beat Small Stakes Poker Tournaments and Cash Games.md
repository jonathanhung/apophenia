- Your premium made hands should be played aggressively because you want to play a big pot with them. The main way you get to play a big pot in No-Limit Hold’em is to bet. It is important to understand that a “premium hand” does not simply mean any hand that is better than middle pair. Sometimes top pair with a weak kicker is a premium hand and other times it is junk. Broadly, this range is comprised of top pair with a decent kicker and all better made hands. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtq1hpxqz1yfm4f3g077rzft))
- The main benefit of checking your marginal made hands is you force your opponent to stay in the pot with a wide range that you crush. Take a look at how Q-J on K-J-5 fares against a normal button calling range when you bet and your opponent calls:
  QJo
  48.46%
  QQ-TT,55,ATs,A5s,KJs-K9s,Q9s+, J8s+,AJo-ATo,KTo+,QTo+,JTo
  51.54%
  You have 48% equity when you bet and get called, meaning that even with this decently strong hand, when you bet and get called by all reasonable hands your opponent could have (including a few gutshot straight draws that some players fold) you are slightly behind.
  Now compare this to the situation when you check:
  QJo
  68.82%
  QQ-22,ATs-A2s,KJs-K9s,Q9s+,J8s+,T8s+, 97s+,86s+,76s,65s,AJo-ATo,KTo+,QTo+,JTo
  31.18%
  That is much better! By checking and forcing your opponent to stay in with a wide range, you are in great shape. That ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtq1w86ptz41ss08jzhyjg29))
- Many players incorrectly think that a straight draw plus a flush draw has 17 outs, whereas, in reality, it has 15. They mistakenly count twice the straight cards that also bring in the flush. So, instead of nine flush outs and eight straight outs, you have nine flush outs and six straight outs (because the other two make a flush).
