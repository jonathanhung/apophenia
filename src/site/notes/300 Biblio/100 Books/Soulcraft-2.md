- F or over twenty years, I’ve been guiding people into the wilderness — not just the redrock canyons and snow-crested mountains of the American Southwest but, more essentially, into the wilds of our own souls. I call this work soulcraft. (Page 34)
- I’ve found that my clients’ discontents are often rooted in an unmet longing for wildness, mystery, and a meaningful engagement with the world. (Page 34)
- much wilder environments are needed to recover the innate treasures, the secrets of destiny, buried beneath the surface of our daily routines. Soulcraft is an approach to the psyche and the world that embraces both wild nature and the depths of our souls; it could be called an eco-depth psychology (Page 34)
- an eco-depth psychology (Page 34)
- Contemporary society has lost touch with soul and the path to psychological and spiritual maturity, or true adulthood. Instead, we are encouraged to create lives of predictable security, false normality, material comfort, bland entertainment, and the illusion of eternal youth (Page 34)
- in Fortunately, many people industrialized cultures of Western the civilization recognize that a fulfilling life is not about superfluous economic advancement, that modest amounts of security and comfort serve adequately as foundations for a creative and soul-stirring life, and that each of us can bring a unique gift to the world, a world desperately in need of the socially transforming contributions of initiated, actively engaged adults (Page 35)
- a psyche the size of the earth. (Page 35)
- For any journey into the wilderness, it helps to pack a map of the territory (Page 35)
- before you embarked, you sketched your intended route on your map, you’d be more li (Page 35)
- what the descent is, why it is necessary, how to recognize the call to descend, how to prepare for the descent, what the process looks and feels like, and what practices initiate and accelerate the descent and maximize the soulquickening benefits of the journey (Page 35)
- We’ll look into the call to adventure that signals the opportunity to descend to your depths. You might imagine the first three chapters to be a briefing from your guide on the eve of departu (Page 35)
- The first is the archetype of human nature most resonant with mysterious journeys, the Wanderer. The second is the cocoon, a symbol of the (Page 35)
- utterly transformative nature of your quest. These images are explored in chapter 4. (Page 36)
- the truth is that you are fully eligible for a meaningful life, a mystical life, a life of the greatest fulfillment and service. To enter that life, you do not need to join a tribal culture or renounce your religious values. You do not necessarily need to quit your job, sell or give away your home, or learn to eat only vegetables. You do, however, need to undertake a journey as joyous and gratifying as it is long and difficult. You will perhaps have to make sacrifices of the greatest sort along the way, but you will not be able to determine what they might be before you start (Page 40)
- Nonetheless, to put things in proper perspective, please remember that at no point will you be asked to sacrifice any social roles, material objects, or self-images that you won’t lose anyway at the time of your final breath. S (Page 40)
- unique way of belonging to this world, to recover the never-before-seen treasure we were born to bring to our communities (Page 40)
- To carry this treasure to others is half of our spiritual longing. The other half is to experience our oneness with the universe, with all of creation. (Page 40)
- But we also suspect that saying no to our deepest desires will mean self-imprisonment in a life too small. And a far-off voice within insists that the never-before-seen treasure is well worth any sacrifices and difficulty in recovering it. (Page 41)
- yes, we want to be healed, we want to be made whole, we’re willing to go some distance, but we’re not willing to question the fundamental assumptions upon which our way of life has been built, both personally and societally. We ignore the still, small voice. We’re not willing to risk losing what we have. We just want more. (Page 41)
- It is a journey downward into the dark mysteries of the individual soul. This is a journey on which, as the great German poet Rainer Maria Rilke put it, we are asked to trust not our lightness but our heaviness: (Page 41)
- Only we, in our arrogance, push out beyond what we each belong to for some empty freedom. (Page 42)
- If we surrendered to earth’s intelligence we could rise up rooted, like trees. (Page 42)
- descent to the underworld. (Page 42)
- They imply we each must undertake the journey of descent if we are to heal ourselves at the deepest levels and reach a full and authentic adulthood, that there are powerful and dangerous beings in the underworld who are not particularly friendly or attractive, and that we are forever changed by the experienc (Page 43)
- The hero or heroine of mythology represents you and me, the everyday self (the I, or ego). If and when you embark upon the underworld adventure, it begins the same way it does in myth — by leaving home. You leave your commonplace world and roles and your familiar way of understanding yourself. (Page 43)
- you descend either way (Page 44)
- “a world of unfamiliar y (Page 44)
- “a world of unfamiliar yet strangely intimate forces.” This is precisely how the underworld feels — although exotic and uncanny, the beings you encounter there seem to know you because, after all, they embody the previously denied aspects of your larger self. (Page 44)
- strangely intimate forces.” This is precisely how (Page 44)
- the underworld feels — (Page 44)
- although exotic and uncanny, the beings you encounter there seem to know you because, after all, they embody the previously denied aspects of your larger self (Page 44)
- you undergo a supreme ordeal that puts a decisive end to your old self-image (ego death) and leads to your reward, the recovery of your core soul knowledge. (Page 44)
- your old self-image (ego death) a (Page 44)
- core soul knowledge. (Page 44)
- The gift you carry for others is not an attempt to save the world but to fully belong to it. It’s not possible to save the world by trying to save it. You need to find what is genuinely yours to offer the world before you can make it a better place. Discovering your unique gift to bring to your community is your greatest opportunity and challenge. The offering of that gift — your true self — is the most you can do to love and serve the world. (Page 44)
- to fully (Page 44)
- belong to it. It’s not possible to save the world by trying to save it. (Page 44)
- It is a world from which the true elders have largely disappeared, the elders who once possessed intimate knowledge of soul and who waited for us at the underworld threshold to guide us across (Page 45)
- it can be found in the shamanic traditions of nature-based peoples, in the esoteric branches of the great world religions, in the few remaining mystery schools, in the verses of the soul poets, and in modern depth psychology. (Page 45)
- With the support of nature and an underworld guide, our souls can show us how to re-create a relationship with mystery. We have only to learn how to look and then take our next step upon the journe (Page 45)
- The most effective paths to soul are nature-based. Nature — the outer nature we call “the wild” — has always been the essential element and the primary setting of the journey to soul. The soul, after all, is our inner wilderness, the intrapsychic terrain we know the least and that holds our individual mysterie (Page 46)
- Nature — the outer nature we call “the wild” — has always been the essential element and the primary setting of the journey to soul (Page 46)
- Perhaps this is why many people regard their souls in much the same way they view deserts, jungles, oceans, wild mountains, and dark forests — as dangerous and forbidding places (Page 46)
- nature and soul not only depend on each other but long for each other and are (Page 46)
- The individual soul is the core of our human nature, the reason for which we were born, the essence of our specific life purpose, and ours alone. Yet our true nature is at first a mystery to our everyday mind. (Page 46)
- Thomas Berry, the cultural historian and religious scholar, reminds us that the word nature comes from the Latin natus, “to be born,” and that the nature of a thing “has to do with that dynamic principle that holds something together and gives it its identity (Page 47)
- our souls long for a world in which nature can embody itself fully and diversely (Page 47)
- far enough from the routines of our civilized live (Page 47)
- far enough, that is, into wilderness — (Page 47)
- essential qualities of our deepest selves (Page 47)
- beautiful and terrifying shapes of your own so (Page 47)
- Cultivating a relationship to soul and transforming your life take time and hard work. Although soulcraft practice almost always generates psycho-spiritual benefits, the full encounter with soul requires the surrender of control and predictability. Your ego must be shocked or shifted in a way that extracts you from your surface life. (Page 48)
- The pull toward soul feels like an earthquake in the midst of your life (Page 48)
- The call is much more than an urge for an extended vacation, a challenging project, or a new career or social scene. You may think you are simply going to leave home for a while, learn something new, and return to what you always thought was yours, but you will not in fact be in control. You might one day return to the place where home existed and find only ashes (Page 48)
- unexpected, the (Page 48)
- call is preceded by ominous tremors. For me, those tremors rippled beneath the (Page 48)
- ground of my early professional career (Page 48)
- beneath the veneer of outward success, I was an insincere stranger in a strange land of crowded classrooms and deadly committee meetings. (Page 48)
- no true devotion or enthusiasm. (Page 48)
- my deepest motivations were social and financial security, professional status, and self-aggrandizemen (Page 49)
- The sprouting tree of my career did not have its roots dug into the deeper desires of soul (Page 49)
- I heard the call to adventure a few times in my early twenties, but I didn’t know who or what was calling. Finally, on that winter day in the Adirondacks, I got rattled in a way I couldn’t ignore. As I ascended Cascade Mountain on snowshoes, climbing toward a gold and blue dome, I felt emotionally torn: on the one hand, I exulted in the freedom and wildness of the mountains — untamed nature, where I felt most at home. On the other, I dragged my professorial life behind me like an anchor. I wondered why I didn’t find my career more fulfilling and hoped I only needed a little more time to get settled. But, upon reaching the summit, my understanding of life changed and my adolescent trance ended. Lost in a sea of white peaks, I was pierced by an unfathomable sadness for a loss that was at once mine and not mine, and a hope for something bigger than I knew to hope for. Sadness and hope coursed through my veins and gathered in my belly. I stood perfectly still, hardly risking a breath. Half-crazed, I scanned every facet of the vast snowscape below as if something precious and essential to me was hidden there, in a concealed valley or the shadow of a river bend. (Page 49)
- to Then, the truth exploded into my awareness. I heard myself gasp. There was no denying it: my university tenure track was a spiritual dead end and I simply inevitable had incomprehension from family and colleagues, despite my not knowing where I would go, how I would survive, or who I would be. leave, despite my promising career, despite the (Page 49)
- We must undergo an initiation process that does require letting go of the familiar and comfortable. Through ordeals and ecstasies, we come to know what we were born to do, what gift we were meant to bring to the world, what vision is ours to embody. (Page 50)
- We do not easily give up our claim on the good life of extended adolescence, what Jungian analyst James Hollis refers to as our “first adulthood.” (Page 50)
- Nature-based societies, understanding this, provide their youth with extensive preparation for the encounter with soul followed by an arduous initiation rite. These rites, now beginning to reappear in our own society, facilitate the radical shift in consciousness required to turn our focus from familiar egocentric concerns to those of the soul, from our first adulthood to our second. (Page 50)
- the underworld journey is neither understood nor encouraged by the majority of parents, teachers, health professionals, or cultural leaders, to say nothing of mainstream business, science, or politics. Yet a genuine soulful adulthood is possible for everyone. (Page 50)
- creation of our own contemporary (Page 50)
- one’s imminent death is obviously an ego crisis of the greatest magnitude, one that allows soul to break through into consciousness. (Page 51)
- is the greatest blessing to experience such an opening at any time in life, what a shame that for so many this does not occur until the very end, if at all. (Page 51)
- my first spiritual openings came through Eastern paths — Zen, Kundalini Yoga, Taoism, Sufism, and Tibetan Buddhism. But something essential seemed missing even then. Although these disciplines opened consciousness to the peace and joy of the eternal present — to God’s love, perhaps — they seemed dry and austere, too distant from the full human experience. (Page 54)
- something more wild, earthy, and sensual, something spiritually fulfilling in a juicier and more personal way (Page 54)
- I wanted to find out, not just about God but about what was uniquely meaningful and essential to me — what I would be willing to die for, and “how to melt into that fierce heat of living.” (Page 54)
- there were actually two realms involved in spirituality, not one. But none of the teachers with whom I had studied nor any books I read spoke about two realms. (Page 54)
- Most religions omit or obscure the underworld half of the spiritual journey (Page 54)
- that half the story — the divine feminine — has been left out. But this similarity is not coincidental. As we shall see, the wild, earthy, sensual half of the spiritual journey is the half that the therefore as uninitiated masculine mind experiences as feminine and nonessential and perhaps undesirable or even harmful. (Page 54)
- of our surface lives and that opens our awareness to the ultimate and core realities of existence. (Page 55)
- Soulcraft is an exploration of the other realm of spirituality, which leads not upward toward God but downward toward the dark center of our individual selves and into the fruitful mysteries of natu (Page 55)
- By soul I mean the vital, mysterious, and wild core of our individual selves, an essence unique to each person, qualities found in layers of the self much deeper than our personalities. By spirit I mean the single, great, and eternal mystery that permeates and animates everything in the universe and yet transcends all. Ultimately, each soul exists as an agent for spirit. (Page 56)
- By soul I mean the vital, mysterious, and wild core of our individual selves, an essence unique to each person, qualities found in layers of the self much deeper than our personalities. By spirit I mean the single, great, and eternal mystery that permeates and animates everything in the universe and yet transcends all. (Page 56)
- soul: “that small, bright and indescribable wedge of freedom in your own heart,” (Page 56)
- In contrast to soul, the concept of spirit points to what all people, all things, have in common, our shared membership in a single cosmos, each of us a facet of the One Being that contains all (Page 56)
- core powers, our deepest and most enduring powers, those central to our (Page 56)

- most people never come to know themselves this way. Soul discovery requires a lot of work (Page 57)
- The soul is like an acorn. Just as the acorn gives instructions to the oak about how to grow and what to become, the human soul — a type of spiritual blueprint — carries an image or a vision that shows us how to grow, what gift we carry for others, the nature of our true life. (Page 57)
- Spirit and soul are both sacred; they imbue life with meaning, beauty, and mystery. Spirit and soul are both spiritual or transpersonal — they exist beyond the personal, beyond the conventional mind or personality. They might each be referred to as the “sacred Other.” (Page 57)
