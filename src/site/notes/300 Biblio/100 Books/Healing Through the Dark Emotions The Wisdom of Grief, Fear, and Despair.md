    - Note: Emotional reactivity and compensatory or avoidant behaviors [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- The purposefulness of these dark emotions is evident when we can experience them mindfully, tolerate their intense energies, and let them be. Unfortunately, we don’t learn how to do this in a culture that fears and devalues them. Emotion-phobia toxifies dark emotions, leaving our hearts confused and numb, depressed and anxious, isolated and lonely. In emotion-phobic culture, we internalize the idea that befriending what hurts will hurt us, whereas suppressing and avoiding it will make us feel better. We only end up feeling worse ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm96krs93r5fjfq3hckve2m4))
- When I ask the children if they have any feelings about the world as a whole, there is a pregnant pause. Lawrence with the sapphire blue eyes speaks first: “I’m sad that there’s so much violence.” Several children nod their heads, echoing Lawrence’s sadness.
  “I get mad when animals are mistreated,” says Anna. “Like when people hunt and kill them for no reason.”
  “The Gulf War made me really scared,” Danielle reports. “I don’t really understand why it had to happen.”
  The last to speak is Will, a small boy with big eyes: “I think at the rate we’re polluting the earth, by the time I grow up there won’t be much left that’s clean and good for me.”
  By comparison to the emotional intelligence of many adults, these kids are emotionally gifted. They have an intuitive grasp of what feelings are and what they’re for. They know that emotions are energies in the body that convey information, seek expression, and motivate action. Their emotional vocabulary is nuanced and wide-ranging. And they know that emotions, while “inner,” are responses to the larger world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm96nshz12bp24b5rpbvk5vr))
    - Note: Children understand emotions as wisdom and important responses to the world [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- As they grow up, all this will change. Their ability to express their emotions openly without shame will be drastically reduced. Their emotional IQ will be lowered. Their sensitivity to the violence, war, and pollution in the world around them will be decreased. Their intuitive grasp of the connection between their emotions and what’s happening in the world will be supplanted by adult ways of ignoring, rationalizing, and denying what they can’t bear to feel. The more educated among them, trained in a post-Freudian worldview, will believe that the prime cause of emotional suffering lies in early childhood experience. Their understanding of the impact of the social environment on their emotional lives will shrink to a list of parental failings, particularly those of their mothers. Many of them will be at a great remove from the felt experience of emotion in their bodies, preferring to locate feelings in their heads. The natural pathway by which emotions seek expression will be constrained by adult prohibitions or obstructed by denial. The enthusiasm and impassioned inquiry in these young students will be replaced by a strong wariness and fear. Once so colorful and interesting, emotions will now appear dangerous, inferior to reason, best kept under tight control. The children’s hearts will have forgotten the magic of emotion.

- Grown-up ideas about the dark emotions reflect this internalized emotion-phobia. In groups and workshops I’ve led, I ask participants to complete an Emotion-Beliefs Inventory consisting of a series of sentence completions: (1) What my grief (fear, despair) says about me is . . . (2) If I got in touch with my grief (fear, despair), and let myself feel it fully, I would . . . (3) What I would most like to do with my grief (fear, despair) is . . .
  Here are some typical responses:
  • What my grief says about me is that I’m pitiful. If I felt it fully, I would never stop crying. What I’d most like to do with my grief is be done with it.
  • What my fear says about me is that I’m weak, unable to cope, a coward. If I felt it fully, I would be unable to function, become immobile, be paralyzed, die. What I’d most like to do with my fear is kill it.
  • What my despair says about me is that I’m desperate, weak, spiritually undeveloped, totally defeated. If I let myself feel it fully, I would be isolated, wouldn’t want to live anymore, would die, would kill myself. What I’d most like to do with my despair is overcome it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm96x3pch3m4y1ye2fyy9nbv))
    - Note: how we typically think about the dark emotions [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Most adults have the entrenched idea that emotions like sorrow, despair, and fear are crippling, destructive, and “negative.” That last word says it all. If we thought there was anything honorable or valuable about the dark emotions, we wouldn’t refer to them this way. These emotions not only feel bad; we think they are bad—signs of emotional weakness, moral decay, spiritual inferiority, and personal inadequacy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm96xa7yezw6dnh49h1v6601))
- Most of us experience a constant flow of emotions on a daily basis. Even smaller dark emotions can become a problem when we don’t know how to handle them and they accumulate as unhealthy stress. But when the dark emotions are more of a tidal wave than a small ebb and flow, emotional energy can become highly toxic. Like all energy, emotional energy doesn’t just disappear. It changes form. The essence of emotional alchemy is the mindful flow of emotional energy—a process in which we are consciously attentive to what is happening. When we can master this process, the dark emotions organically transform to spiritual strengths such as gratitude, joy, faith, courage, and compassion. But when we unmindfully suppress emotional energy it often converts to mental states and destructive behaviors that are subsequently diagnosed as “mental disorders ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm97ev6an1g98r587grzjqwr))

- TRANSCEND OR BYPASS
  Transcendence is about “rising above” our feelings. Sometimes we can do this by setting our sights on something “higher.” But in most cases, to transcend suffering authentically, we must be willing to live it fully. To rise above, we must go through—without any guarantees of what we’ll find on the other side.
  Problems arise when we mistake what some have called a “spiritual bypass” of suffering with genuine transcendence. The latter, in my experience, is not something you can plan, predict, or control. It’s the gift of grace ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm97qh7dwrgfxggx2yt4p8ad))
- ESCAPE
  Escape would probably win the contest for most popular way of coping with suffering in the West. And nobody does it better than we do. Americans have mastered the art of distraction and escape to the highest point of any nation, and we are teaching what we know to the rest of the world—exporting more and more entertainment, celebrity worship, and addictive consumerism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm97qy6cbjyaxxxw0mqsk7yt))
- Emotion-Phobia and the Head/Heart Split
  For many centuries, we have lived in the shadow of the great divide between reason and emotion—the head/heart split in which the Western world, since Plato, has been schooled. We believe that our rationality is what makes us human and thereby distinctly different from the apes. Emotions, as part of our instinctual animal nature, are seen as dangerous and inferior to reason. We believe that submitting to their unencumbered, uncontrolled, free flow would destroy our capacity to think and function rationally, would make us dangerous, or win us a permanent place in the loony bin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm981pt982h5fwxfeq5kbv0k))
- the head/heart split is a source of profound disconnection. Affect is detached and dissociated from cognition. We learn not to feel through what we think, not to think through what we feel. In separating reason from emotion, we’ve been conditioned to place our trust in the former, culturally masculine attribute, and not the latter, culturally feminine one. We associate reason with strength, merit, safety, and men; emotion with weakness, wildness, danger, and women. Emotion-phobia—the fundamental fear of the raw power of emotional energy—is bolstered by this set of normative, gender-polarized beliefs about the supremacy of reason over emotion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm982eyhzc5mpg144tntpsns))
- The head/heart split is not just a matter of what we think about what we feel. It’s also about how we actually experience our feelings. Few of us have ever experienced a free flow of emotion unimpeded by “rational” control yet monitored by full awareness. Few of us know how to feel our emotions fully in the body and to completion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm986cbbc894rrtz4y2ry37c))
- Models of Emotional Control: Contain and Manage
  When we don’t trust the energy of “negative” emotions, the best we think we can do is to contain and manage it. Containment, as a strategy of emotional coping, bears the stamp of the masculine norm that guides our thinking and behavior in the murky, feminized realm of emotion. Starting with Aristotle, who posited that reason’s control over emotion is what distinguishes men from women and children, we have all lived in the shadow of this patriarchal belief system.
  As an overall emotional management strategy, control is useful in a limited way. At best, it helps us to reign in impulsive, destructive behavior. But control is not always a rational choice. It can be and often is a socially sanctioned compulsion. Destructive behavior can be a result of too much control as well as too little control. We compulsively control the dark emotions when we lack the ability to tolerate them. This kind of suppression is not necessarily a conscious choice, especially since conscious awareness is not something promoted in our culture, while avoidance, distraction, and escape are. Too much of this kind of control breeds its opposite: emotional explosion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm98872bcppxr97spkh9rh6z))
- Acting out is not always so harmless. My most controlled clients are often the ones most likely to act out, and in the process do some serious damage to their relationships and themselves. The married man at midlife who enjoys what looks like a decent marriage and a highly ordered life and then launches a torrid affair with a younger woman that wrecks his marriage and his life may sound like a cliché, but this is a common form of acting out that destroys marriages and produces a great deal of suffering for children who get caught in the cross-fire. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm98gwet6emhhsp9pa9bxh8c))
- This is emotional flow. When the dark emotions are tolerated, mindfully expressed and allowed to flow to completion, they change their valence. Esther’s sorrow about losing camp and her gratitude for camp were two sides of the same coin.
  Emotional flow is a source of connection to self and others. Esther’s sorrow and gratitude were felt by everyone in the circle in his or her own way—a transpersonal energy linking the sorrow and gratitude in everyone’s hearts ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm98mp99k40br6x8grk1q6md))
- Despite its considerable contribution to valuing and understanding emotions, Goleman’s work is limited by a masculine bias against the emotional brain itself. In this system, the ability to impede the flow of emotions is dubbed the “Master Aptitude.” Dominance and subordination are major metaphors. Emotional control is the goal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm98p5qavdfmre1cq0p5jf0x))
- Despite its considerable contribution to valuing and understanding emotions, Goleman’s work is limited by a masculine bias against the emotional brain itself. In this system, the ability to impede the flow of emotions is dubbed the “Master Aptitude.” Dominance and subordination are major metaphors. Emotional control is the goal.
  Contrast this to the work of Candace Pert, a pioneering neuroscientist and author of Molecules of Emotion: Why You Feel the Way You Feel. In Pert’s model (backed up by her research), emotional intelligence is suffused throughout the body. The neuropeptides and receptors that carry emotional information exist not only in the brain but in the endocrine, gastrointestinal, and immune systems as well. Emotional intelligence hinges not on one part of the brain dominating another, but on a smoothly flowing system of emotional “infoenergy” throughout the body/mind. Emotions don’t need to be ruled; they need to be tolerated and expressed. They have an intelligence unto themselves, not when they are dominated, but when they are free-flowing.[2](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/15009967#filepos910468) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm98pxqeasdfsxpy089v9zz3))
    - Note: Goleman pioneered a sense of emotional intelligence that subordinated feeling to reason and asserted that feelings were meant to be controlled not expressed or felt. 
      In contrast, emotional intelligence according to Candace Pert was one where emotions had a wisdom throughout the body, not about one part subordinating another. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- What Goleman wants control to accomplish is better accomplished through emotional tolerance and mindfulness. These skills prevent the dark emotions from becoming destructive. When we can tolerate emotional energy mindfully, we can control our impulses without suppressing our emotions. Strictly speaking, it’s not our emotions that we control, but our actions. The emotional intelligence of the dark emotions moves us not to management but to transformation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmf4jbp5d8k1zb29wngeqfev))
- When we can mindfully attend to, tolerate, and surrender to the energy of the dark emotions as it flows, we open the heart’s doorway to the magic of emotional alchemy. These are the three basic skills: Attending, Befriending, and Surrendering (ABS) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmf4mfhpck6408014q3rdn6j))

- ATTENDING: LEARNING TO LISTEN
  To attend to the dark emotions is to sense them in the body, focus your awareness on them, and name them accurately. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp39f6gq8fs9z9w2nvdtj34))
- Attending to emotional energy is a bodily-grounded awareness. It means knowing how to feel your feelings, as opposed to knowing how to describe them without feeling them. It also includes emotional literacy, the ability to find accurate words for emotional states. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp3aggb8hwvf56gz66ed3rt))
    - Note: Developing an attention for how you're feeling, describing them, naming them. If you feel numb, maybe pay attention to that numbness and name it. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Suppose you are not much of a feeling person. If your body is numb to emotions, attending to the numbness is the first step toward emotional alchemy. Just pay conscious attention to the numbness, and see what happens.
  I once did some bodywork therapy with a gifted therapist. The therapy method was simply to be aware of emotions, thoughts, and sensations in the body and stay focused on them as they appeared. In a state of relaxation, I became aware of what looked like a white box of static energy surrounding my body. My body seemed to be lying in the box, numb and inert. Attending to this numbness was difficult. It was hard to stay focused because numbness is actually uncomfortable and boring. Encouraged by the therapist, I just kept paying attention to the numbness for quite some time.
  After a while it began to look like a kind of cocoon. My tendency was to try to break out of this cocoon in a dramatic and explosive way, but I didn’t. I just paid attention. Gradually, the cocoon began to break up of its own accord, but very, very slowly, requiring great patience on my part not to just flail out. When I finally came through it, I felt an electric surge of energy streaming throughout my body—an intense, all-body orgasmic-like release of the grief that the cocoon had been holding inside, masked by the numbness.

    - Note: Transmuting numbness. 
      I may have been feeling numb in being around oz, like my emotional reactions were likely unwelcome or going to be greeted with rejection. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- BEFRIENDING: YOU HAVE TO FEEL IT IF YOU WANT TO HEAL IT
  Befriending emotional energy is a further extension of attending to it. It entails extending our emotional attention span. Befriending emotional energy is what psychologists call “affect tolerance.” When you build your tolerance for the dark emotions, they don’t become overwhelming or lead you to act out. In befriending the dark emotions, you let them be. You don’t try to suppress, dispel, avoid, deny, analyze, or distract yourself from them. Nor do you melodramatically indulge or mindlessly vent them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp3fz6bbkmpbx0z1v53pw1v))
    - Note: common coping strategies for negative emotions involve suppressing, dispel (saying that they're not real), avoiding, denying, analyzing, distraction. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- When you are flooded with sorrow, what happens to your body? Do you feel tears welling up in your chest? In your eyes? What is your reaction to this welling up of grief? Do you then begin to feel agitated and speedy? Or depleted and tired? What stories does your mind begin to spin? For example, do you think, “Here I am, feeling sad again. What’s wrong with me?”
  Similarly, when you are scared, how does your body feel? Do you even let yourself actually experience the feeling or do you immediately call a friend, turn on the television, or go out for a drink? What is your mental reaction to your fear? Do you think, “I’m such a wimp”?
  When you begin to feel despondent or despairing, how does your body feel? Again, have you ever trained your attention to the bodily experience, or do you simply go immediately into mental overdrive, trying to analyze or explain away your feelings? Do you think, “Oh, no. I’d better get out of this mood or I’ll never be able to function.” Or, “Uh oh. Better get my medication increased.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp3nsdpste1s58az5r45g1j))
    - Note: How do you relate to your dark emotions? What stories do you tell, what's your reaction. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- SURRENDERING: TO LET IT GO, YOU HAVE TO LET IT FLOW
  Surrendering is an extension of befriending emotional energy. It’s about allowing emotional energy to flow to its end point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp3qzmpdh9cwaxt66w7deqb))
- While the alchemy of the dark emotions is a nonlinear and creatively chaotic process, its three basic skills can be taught and learned. We learn these skills by practicing them. The emotional exercises at the end of the next three chapters (and in part four’s “home course”) are designed to help you practice the skills through a series of seven interrelated steps: (1) intention, (2) affirmation, (3) bodily sensation, (4) contextualization, (5) the way of non-action, (6) the way of action, and (7) the way of surrender ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmf3b6w03f346rqqv4z7c3tf))
- A basic axiom of surrender is: To let it go, you have to let it flow. You can’t fully let go of a dark emotion until you’ve fully experienced its truth. That usually means a whole lot of befriending has to happen before you can let go of the emotion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp3rbnfvn3m9fbevkvjrf7m))
    - Note: to let go of the emotion you must move towards it, fully experienced the truth of it. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- You don’t surrender by moving away from what hurts. You surrender by moving into what hurts, with awareness as your protection. This is not “detachment” in the conventional sense; it’s connected detachment: staying connected to emotional energy mindfully. The detachment comes from being mindful, not from disconnecting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp3xvn65gbkq1rvfprq08kz))
    - Note: you aren't protected by moving away from it, avoiding it. You are protected by your awareness and staying mindful of it, not detaching. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- “If I surrender, won’t I become overwhelmed and dysfunctional?” Actually, the opposite is true. Surrender is a form of deep acceptance. It’s saying yes to emotions we’d prefer to say no to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp3zkqjajnk7ky4vtfb79gw))
- Your ordinary ego wants relief, wants out, wants escape. But your spirit has a wider view of things, can be patient, wants to realize itself—even in the midst of pain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmf4dgvebrekjkhg0b4086gb))
- For example, people often come to therapy with the expectation: “The therapist will fix me by taking away my bad feelings.” Their intention often reflects a profound, unconscious longing to be rescued from their own emotions. There is nothing wrong with this longing. In fact, paying attention to it will draw out all the dark emotions one would rather not face. The expectation of being fixed is like wanting to be airlifted out of a war zone. Of course you want the helicopter to come and take you away. But the fact is, this is a down-to-earth journey, and you have to actually walk through the terrain to get where you’re going—to arrive at a place of emotional peace and freedom. If you want to be rescued, you are likely to wait passively for someone to do it for you or to you instead of engaging your own resources for emotional transformation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp431ynfhr43847tb2tz9jx))
    - Note: conscious intention differs from expecting something, someone or an external agent to save you. 
      intention sets up the expectation of walking the terrain to arrive at emotional peace and freedom. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- So the therapy-goer’s initial intention needs to be modified from “I want someone to take my emotions away” to “I want to get to know these emotions better and find out what they’re trying to tell me.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp44kaz3ywdwjhkjx064gt4))
- STEP 2. AFFIRMATION: DEVELOPING AN EMOTION-POSITIVE ATTITUDE
  The second step in the alchemy of the dark emotions is affirming their wisdom. It entails changing what you think about what you feel. We’re all conditioned in an emotion-phobic culture and have internalized many ideas about the “negativity” of painful feelings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp485b3ts7b5vgment9ty64))
- There’s a difference between what you’d like to believe and what you do believe on a body level. Subconscious beliefs are deeply entrenched and have a tenacious way of holding on—the same way that unconscious emotions do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp48ffrkh62tb06qk2bkddf))
    - topic:: [[embodied-knowledge\|embodied-knowledge]] 
- STEP 3. BODILY SENSATION: SENSING, SOOTHING, AND NAMING EMOTIONS
  I can’t say this enough: Feelings are in your body. Talking about feelings is not the same as experiencing them. Emotional intelligence is a bodily intelligence, so if you want to do emotional alchemy, you have to know how to listen to your body. This is the skill of emotional sensitivity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp4akwpz1a2med55bwxde69))
- Listening to the body’s emotion language is often harder for men, who are encouraged to develop strong “body armor” to defend against the fluidity and vulnerability of emotional energy—which, in our culture, is associated with femininity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp4drpmerk9a292620182c1))
- In addition to sensing emotion in the body, it’s important to know how to soothe emotional energy when it becomes very intense. Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk and spiritual leader, speaks of how we must “lullaby” our anger and despair. Soothing these emotions is essential, he says, because it prevents us from acting hastily or carelessly.
  Most of us never got enough soothing as children. When we were emotionally troubled, we were more likely ignored, shamed, or punished than soothed. As adults, we still suffer from a lack of soothing. Given the state of the world and its everyday assaults and stressors (including the speed at which we in the West are now living and the overwhelming inundation of information we have to contend with, as well as the everyday violence of the culture), we could all stand to be rocked like babies every day! But even if you’ve got someone to do this for you, it’s important to be able to soothe yourself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp4f8c79cnt92mfb8w8yqmg))

- STEP 4. CONTEXTUALIZATION: TELLING A WIDER STORY ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp4jdrkt82avm8pd152a05f))
- To practice emotional alchemy, you have to be acquainted with the story you are currently telling about your emotional suffering and recontextualize it in a broader social, cultural, global, or cosmic context. There is a profound connection between emotional alchemy and emotional ecology. Without knowing that connection, we’re doomed to the ego’s endless whining. Making the connection between our own personal pain and the pain of the world is an essential part of emotional alchemy because it gets us out of the isolation that the dark emotions tend to impose, especially in an emotion-phobic culture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp4jw1bp7rgt5hbc7011r5z))
    - Note: Step 4: Set the feelings in context. Feeling these painful emotions is a result of these long-standing forces: colonialism, patriarchy, capitalism. It's intergenerational & systemic, it's not necessarily that you're bad. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Your core defect story explains your suffering by reference to a core sense of shame about who you are. (In emotion-phobic culture, feeling shame about one’s pain is normal.) When you are in pain, you tend to resort to your core defect story as an explanation for it. Your boyfriend just left and you feel abandoned, sad, and angry. The reason he left, you tell yourself, is that you’re not pretty enough, thin enough, sexy enough. In fact, the truth may be that he left because he’s not ready for a relationship with the level of intimacy that you want. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp4sqn9b9574253rvvz6a6g))
    - Note: Core defect is that if my feelings and needs are known, people will reject me. Or I need to perform or be perfect in order to be loved. 
      Numbing as a defense response for that. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Abuse and violence of all kinds are intergenerationally transmitted in families. What happens to the capacity to love in these larger contexts of abuse and violence? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp50vejc2f8g9vntdr0nxms))
- In the step I call contextualizing, your own ego’s pain is seen and experienced in connection to the pain of the world. When you can see your emotional suffering as part of a much larger story, you build wisdom and compassion for yourself and others, for the world as a whole. Compassion is both a necessary ingredient and a lasting gift in the alchemy of the dark emotions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp5270emc7q4dbqd9dzkbrh))
- STEP 5. THE WAY OF NON-ACTION: BEFRIENDING WHAT HURTS
  The way of non-action develops the skill of affect tolerance. When you can tolerate the feeling of grief, fear, or despair in the body without acting prematurely to suppress it, you are practicing the way of non-action. Being able to focus and sustain awareness in the midst of turbulent or painful states of emotion is perhaps the most critical skill of emotional intelligence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp52p7t6x49hvct5hda6by0))
- When we move our grief, fear, and despair into conscious acts on behalf of ourselves and others, these emotions become transformative. But the way of action can also be practiced through personal acts of kindness to self and others, however small. This is something we can practice even when we are at a loss for what do to.

- In grief’s alchemy, however, the first phase is not about moving on but about being broken, a searing experience that cannot be pacified by all the compassionate counsel in the world. Healing through grief doesn’t start when we give up feeling bad; it begins with the agony of loss. The merciful numbing of shock must wear off and the reality of death take hold. Grief must sink in. In the alchemy of grief, going down always precedes coming up. Understandable but misguided attempts to speed up the process tend to derail it. Generally, a grief deferred is a grief prolonged. There are no short-cuts in the alchemy of the dark emotions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp5e2mkgbddbayta3nrb5bk))
- The grief process does not alter their sense of self or the meaning they attribute to loss. They do not change or grow from a spiritual standpoint. Because loss is an inevitable part of life, grief for human beings is an important and largely neglected aspect of psychospiritual development, as well as a profound healing process. Whatever the nature and extent of the loss, we grieve because we are not alone, because we are interconnected; and what connects us to one another also breaks our hearts.

- Grief exists on a spectrum, from the “milder” sorrows of a best friend moving to another state, to the more absolute losses: the death of a marital partner, parent, or child. I use the words grief and sorrow interchangeably. Sorrow is the milder word, used to describe the emotions one feels in the wake of neglect, betrayal, abandonment, and abuse. But grief, the stronger word, is equally applicable to all of these kinds of loss in relationship. The grief following separation and divorce (given that one out of every two American marriages ends in divorce) is one of the most common forms of this dark emotion.

- Griefwork is not a return to the pre-loss status quo. People do not get “back to normal” after a child dies, or after any profound loss.

  This question is asked from the strikingly narcissistic point of view of the conventional self, based on its “normal” distortion of reality: the illusion of being the center of the universe. The world turns as it did before precisely because the conventional ego is not at the center of it! Loss, particularly sudden or unexpected death, shatters the ego’s normal grandiosity, its center-stage illusion of control.

- EXPANSION
  > Excess of sorrow laughs. Excess of joy weeps.
  > Joys impregnate. Sorrows bring forth.
  > —WILLIAM BLAKE,Proverbs of Hell
  We don’t choose grief, it chooses us. But we do have a choice in how we deal with it. We have the choice to let it be, not to rush it, to honor it in the way that we are called to. “Choosing” grief, in this sense, provides the grounding for the alchemy of grief to unfold. It is an inner intention that says: I will let this grief mold me to its purpose, rather than try to rein it in, stay in charge of it. And this inner intention, this choice, is what begins the process that I call “expansion”—the development of an enlarged sense of self through the grieving process.

- This is why many people who are grieving at some point come up against the judgments, inhibitions, and unsolicited advice of well-meaning others. And the advice is generally in the same vein as that of Doris’s roommate: Don’t grieve too much. Don’t show your grief too visibly. Get busy, move on, don’t look too sad.
  The message is: Get your old self back in shape. And it is a message that is reinforced by psychologists in the bereavement field who mark the stages of grief by the capacity to return to “normal.” The “get back to normal” message impedes the flow of grief. If we are in a hurry to dispel grief in order to get back to baseline, we are in danger of wasting the profound opportunity in grief for transformations of consciousness that make baseline appear quite limited.

- Grief, like despair, is an emotion that asks us to depart from the “normal”—to be still, like a pool of frozen water in the winter. From out of this apparent stillness, an imperceptible movement occurs, from sorrow for what has been lost to gratitude for what remains. The trick is to let go and descend into grief’s cold waters.

- Among observant Jews, the practice of “sitting shivah” keeps the mourner from returning to routine too soon. In the seven days following the burial (shivah means “seven” in Hebrew), the mourners stay at home and receive visitors for most of the day. People come to comfort and console; to bring food and drink; and perhaps most of all, to give the mourners an opportunity to remember the dead and to give voice to their grief. Ancient mourning customs are followed, including the draping of mirrors with a black cloth so as not to interrupt grieving with attention to grooming and appearances. The ritual is about encouraging an openness to the grief process. Mourning is gradually stepped down—the seven days followed by a thirty-day period of less severe mourning, and then an eleven-month period when the mourner’s prayer is said twice a day; after that, the dead are remembered ritually once a year.

- If bereavement is normal, why call the common experiences of grief “symptoms”? Symptoms of what? Of loss? Is loss a pathology?
  This way of thinking about grief wants to knock out the “symptoms” quickly, so that you won’t have to undergo the often prolonged process of transformation through grief. Not everyone wants to go through such a process, certainly. But institutional psychiatry’s bias against loss, death, grief, and darkness in general is part of what has conditioned us to see grief as a “deviation” from life rather than as a normal part of it. The pathology model makes the universal emotion of grief into a psychiatric problem. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp6sw8cfnvgqtxx5b64j4rq))
- After seven years, I noticed a change. The blessings of Aaron’s birth and death had somehow “set in,” and I began to anticipate Aaron’s birthday with a kind of joy. Roger and I decided to celebrate the day with our two daughters. We’d buy a small cake with “Happy Birthday, Aaron” written on it (no age) and a flower ornament. We’d toast our glasses of grape juice champagne and drink to Aaron’s happiness and peace—and to our own. We’d go around the table and say what we were grateful for that day. Usually it was the simple things: each other, the beautiful color of the leaves in fall, our friends. The transformation of grief to gratitude was thus ritualized. But it took considerably longer than two months to get to this. The “resolution” of grief and the transformation through it are not the same process.

This process, for many women, is often a journey of return to those parts of themselves that have been lost in a culture antagonistic to women’s development or in a relationship in which they have given their power over to another.

- Training as a psychotherapist, I learned that the grieving person has six months to feel sad after a major loss, after which the grief response is no longer “normal” and merits the diagnosis of clinical depression. The current diagnostic manual has reduced that time frame to only two months. Dictums such as these only discourage emotional alchemy. The prevailing psychiatric view of grief is based on the assumption that the ego as we know it is the one and only ground of consciousness. With no awareness or acknowledgment of the spiritual dimensions of loss and death, the psychiatric view sees “resolution” as a process of the conventional ego’s readaptation to life after loss, not as a transformative opening to a profoundly new sense of self.

- STEP 7. THE WAY OF SURRENDER: LET GRIEF FLOW
  The simplest exercise for the way of surrender to grief is through prayer. You don’t have to be religious or believe in God to pray. You just need the intention to commune with something larger than your ego. The only requirement is the need to receive help.
  By prayer, I don’t mean reciting words by rote. Prayer is an utterance straight from the heart into the universe. Even if you are not a theist, you can pray so long as you can let yourself open your heart and invite the spirits in. The spirits don’t have to be literal entities that you believe in; this can be a metaphor for opening yourself to the universe, to what is, to being alive. To experience emotional alchemy, you have to get out of ego psychology and into something more expansive. Prayer helps you do this. When you pray, you get out of your own way and let something larger guide you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmp7t6jfxcmdmfdmb6w8jwfc))

- Thank you seems like an impossible prayer when your heart is shattered and broken. And yet, now is a good time to remember what you are thankful for. Think of how grateful you are for those who are still alive and who help hold you up at this time. Think of your life: Are you grateful for it? Or are you in too much pain to feel gratitude? Only pray thank you for what you’re authentically thankful for. Even if it’s only a small, minute thing. Example: I’m thankful for this bed in which I can sleep.
