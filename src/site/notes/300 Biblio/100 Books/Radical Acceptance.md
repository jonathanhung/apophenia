## Highlights 
---
- We are living in a waking dream that completely defines and delimits our experience of life. The rest of the world is merely a backdrop as we struggle to get somewhere, to be a better person, to accomplish, to avoid making mistakes. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=184))
- Feeling unworthy goes hand in hand with feeling separate from others, separate from life. If we are defective, how can we possibly belong? It’s a vicious cycle: The more deficient we feel, the more separate and vulnerable we feel. Underneath our fear of being flawed is a more primal fear that something is wrong with life, that something bad is going to happen. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=189))
- Our feelings of unworthiness and alienation from others give rise to various forms of suffering. For some, the most glaring expression is addiction. ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=193))
- The belief that we are deficient and unworthy makes it difficult to trust that we are truly loved. Many of us live with an undercurrent of depression or hopelessness about ever feeling close to other people. We fear that if they realize we are boring or stupid, selfish or insecure, they’ll reject us. If we’re not attractive enough, we may never be loved in an intimate, romantic way. We yearn for an unquestioned experience of belonging, to feel at home with ourselves and others, at ease and fully accepted. But the trance of unworthiness keeps the sweetness of belonging out of reach. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=197))
- We may feel that the loss of a job or a painful divorce is a reflection of our personal flaws. If we had only done better, if we were somehow different, things would have gone right. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=203))
- Convinced that we are not good enough, we can never relax. We stay on guard, monitoring ourselves for shortcomings. When we inevitably find them, we feel even more insecure and undeserving. We have to try even harder. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=218))
- had the idea that if I really applied myself, it would take eight to ten years to release all my self-absorption and be wise and free. Periodically I would consult teachers I admired from various other spiritual traditions: “So, how am I doing? What else can I do?” Invariably, they would respond, “Just relax.” I wasn’t exactly sure what they meant, but I certainly didn’t think it could be “just relax.” How could they mean that? I wasn’t “there” yet. Chögyam Trungpa, a contemporary Tibetan Buddhist teacher, writes, “The problem is that ego can convert anything to its own use, even spirituality.” ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=248))
- We learn early in life that any affiliation—with family and friends, at school or in the workplace—requires proving that we are worthy. We are under pressure to compete with each other, to get ahead, to stand out as intelligent, attractive, capable, powerful, wealthy. Someone is always keeping score. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=269))
- Spiritual awakening is the process of recognizing our essential goodness, our natural wisdom and compassion. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=276))
- The message of “original sin” is unequivocal: Because of our basically flawed nature, we do not deserve to be happy, loved by others, at ease with life. We are outcasts, and if we are to reenter the garden, we must redeem our sinful selves. We must overcome our flaws by controlling our bodies, controlling our emotions, controlling our natural surroundings, controlling other people. And we must strive tirelessly—working, acquiring, consuming, achieving, e-mailing, overcommitting and rushing—in a never-ending quest to prove ourselves once and for all. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=279))
- the years we each develop a particular blend of strategies designed to hide our flaws and compensate for what we believe is wrong with us. We embark on one self-improvement project after another. We strive to meet the media standards for the perfect body and looks by coloring out the gray, lifting our face, being on a perpetual diet. We push ourselves to get a better position at work. We exercise, take enriching courses of study, meditate, make lists, volunteer, take workshops. Certainly any of these activities can be undertaken in a wholesome way, but so often they are driven by anxious undercurrents of “not good enough.” Rather than relaxing and enjoying who we are and what we’re doing, we are comparing ourselves with an ideal and trying to make up for the difference.

- Playing it safe requires that we avoid risky situations—which covers pretty much all of life. We might not take on leadership or responsibility at work, we might not risk being really intimate with others, we might hold back from expressing our creativity, from saying what we really mean, from being playful or affectionate. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=334))
- The renowned seventh-century Zen master Seng-tsan taught that true freedom is being “without anxiety about imperfection.” ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=408))
- Often we perceive the trance most clearly by recognizing how we want others to see us—and what we don’t want them to see. Bring to mind someone you’ve spent time with recently—someone you like and respect but don’t know well. What do you most want this person to see about you (e.g., that you are loving, generous, attractive)? What do you not want this person to perceive about you (e.g., that you are selfish, insecure, jealous)?      As you go through your day, pause occasionally to ask yourself, “This moment, do I accept myself just as I am?” ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=455))
- Even if we were to win millions of dollars in the lottery or marry the perfect person, as long as we feel not good enough, we won’t be able to enjoy the possibilities before us. ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=490))
- But Radical Acceptance also means not overlooking another important truth: the endless creativity and possibility that exist in living. ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=687))
- Many times since then, especially when I’ve been caught up in tension or self-judgment, I have stopped and asked myself, “What would it be like if I could accept life—accept this moment—exactly as it is?” ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=772))
- But much of our driven pace and habitual controlling in daily life does not serve surviving, and certainly not thriving. It arises from a free-floating anxiety about something being wrong or not enough. ([Location 874](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=874))
- If we look at our own life, we see that such moments of presence often occur in times of stillness or solitude. We have stepped outside the normal rush and into the openness and clarity of a “time out of time.” ([Location 982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=982))
- In bullfighting there is an interesting parallel to the pause as a place of refuge and renewal. It is believed that in the midst of a fight, a bull can find his own particular area of safety in the arena. There he can reclaim his strength and power. This place and inner state are called his querencia. As long as the bull remains enraged and reactive, the matador is in charge. Yet when he finds querencia, he gathers his strength and loses his fear. From the matador’s perspective, at this point the bull is truly dangerous, for he has tapped into his power. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=1053))
- We learn Radical Acceptance by practicing pausing again and again. ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=1117))
- fact, they last longer than the fires of our grasping and fear. It is this that sustains us.” ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=1131))
- We practice Radical Acceptance by pausing and then meeting whatever is happening inside us with this kind of unconditional friendliness. Instead of turning our jealous thoughts or angry feelings into the enemy, we pay attention in a way that enables us to recognize and touch any experience with care. Nothing is wrong—whatever is happening is just “real life.” ([Location 1202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=1202))
- Thich Nhat Hanh calls his practice of yes “smile yoga.” He suggests bringing a slight but real smile to our lips many times throughout the day, whether we are meditating or simply stopping for a red light. “A tiny bud of a smile on your lips,” writes Thich Nhat Hanh, “nourishes awareness and calms you miraculously … your smile will bring happiness to you and to those around you.” The power of a smile to open and relax us is confirmed by modern science. The muscles used to make a smile actually send a biochemical message to our nervous system that it is safe to relax the flight, fight or freeze response. A smile is the yes of unconditional friendliness that welcomes experience without fear. ([Location 1334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2NHG&location=1334))
