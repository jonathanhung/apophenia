## Highlights

- Act 1 is called “Problems and Decisions,” and involves the fundamentals of thinking. Act 2, “Stay Cool Under Pressure,” explores emotions and motivations and the impact of these on thinking. Act 3, “Collaborate with Others,” introduces research on how we might all get along better. Act 4, “Facilitate Change,” focuses on how to create change in others, one of the hardest things to do. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=123))
- “Your prefrontal cortex holds the contents of your mind at any one point,” Arnsten explains. “It’s where we hold thoughts that are not being generated from external sources or from the senses. We ourselves are generating them.” ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=207))
- I am going to introduce a metaphor for the prefrontal cortex that will be used throughout the book. Think of the prefrontal cortex as a stage in a small theater where actors play a part. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=215))
- These five functions, understanding, deciding, recalling, memorizing, and inhibiting, make up the majority of conscious thought. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=236))
- Conscious mental activities chew up metabolic resources, the fuel in your blood, significantly faster than automatic brain functions such as keeping your heart beating or your lungs breathing. The stage requires a lot of energy to function. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=243))
- The first clinical evidence for this limitation came way back in 1898. The scientist J. C. Welsh measured people’s ability to do physical tasks while thinking. She had subjects start a mental task and then asked them to impose as much force as they could, at the same time, on a dynamometer, a machine for measuring force. Her measurements showed that almost all mental tasks reduced maximum force, often by as much as 50 percent. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=246))
- She would prioritize first, before any other attention-rich activity such as emailing. That’s because prioritizing is one of the brain’s most energy-hungry processes. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=304))
- Picturing something you have not yet seen is going to take a lot of energy and effort. This partly explains why people spend more time thinking about problems (things they have seen) than solutions (things they have never seen). It explains why setting goals feels so hard (it’s hard to envision the future). ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=330))
- One way to reduce the energy required for processing information is to use visuals, to literally see something in your mind’s eye. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=344))
- Creating visuals for complex ideas is one way to maximize limited energy resources. Another way involves reducing the load on the prefrontal cortex whenever possible. If Emily gets a piece of paper and writes down the four big projects for the day, she saves her brain for comparing the elements instead of using energy to hold each one. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=356))
- Deep thinking tends to require more effort, so plan to do your deep thinking in one block, perhaps early in the morning or late at night. One big advantage of this strategy is that you can shift around the type of work you do, to let your brain recover. ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=372))
- This means not thinking when you don’t have to, becoming disciplined about not paying attention to non-urgent tasks unless, or until, it’s truly essential that you do. Learning to say no to tasks that are not among your priorities is difficult but very helpful. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=378))
- Think of conscious thinking as a precious resource to conserve. Prioritize prioritizing, as it’s an energy-intensive activity. Save mental energy for prioritizing by avoiding other high-energy-consuming conscious activities such as dealing with emails. Schedule the most attention-rich tasks when you have a fresh and alert mind. Use the brain to interact with information rather than trying to store information, by creating visuals for complex ideas and by listing projects. Schedule blocks of time for different modes of thinking. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=415))
- The mental stage is smaller than you might expect. It’s more like a stage in a child’s bedroom than the one at Carnegie Hall. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=449))
- Relational complexity studies show over and again that the fewer variables you have to hold in mind, the more effective you are at making decisions. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=477))
- If you could draw the map for “credit card processing” on paper, the map for the brain circuitry involved would be more complex than the street directory for the entire United States. ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=497))
- What you can’t do is bring more than a handful of complex maps onto the stage at one time. It’s too much for the brain to manage. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=500))
- It’s like the well-known optical illusion where you see either a vase or an old woman in the same illustration. The brain must settle on one perception at any moment; you can’t see both at once. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=507))
- Since there are limitations to the number of concepts that can be held in mind at one time, the fewer you hold in mind at once the better. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=514))
- I like to think of maximizing working memory as like having a tiny studio apartment, but doing creative things to use the space well, ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=517))
- computer with limited RAM, (which means it can’t hold much short-term information at any one time). You want to create a single-page document with four high-resolution color photographs. Each time you move the photos around, the computer takes several seconds to redraw everything. To get the positioning right, it would be better to move everything around on the page using low-resolution photos first. Once the placement is right, you can then insert the high-resolution color pictures. ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=524))
- Harold Pashler showed that when people do two cognitive tasks at once, their cognitive capacity can drop from that of a Harvard MBA to that of an eight-year-old. It’s a phenomenon called dual-task interference. ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=690))
- A bottleneck is a series of unfinished connections that take up mental energy, forming a queue. Other decisions wait in a queue behind the first decision. ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=788))
- Essentially, if you have to do several things at once, limit the time you spend on this. Consciously decide how long you will split your attention, then go back to focusing on one thing. An example of this is leaving a BlackBerry on for only a limited number of hours a day while you work, perhaps only in the afternoons, when you are not trying to do focused work. ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=800))
- Catch yourself trying to do two things at once and slow down instead. Embed repetitive tasks where you can. Get decisions and thinking processes into the right order to reduce “queues” of decisions. If you have to multitask, combine active thinking tasks only with automatic, embedded routines. ([Location 831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=831))
- Change focus ten times an hour (one study showed people in offices did so as often as twenty times an hour), and your productive thinking time is only a fraction of what’s possible. Less energy equals less capacity to understand, decide, recall, memorize, and inhibit. ([Location 878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=878))
- One of the most effective distraction-management techniques is simple: switch off all communication devices during any thinking work. Your brain prefers to focus on things right in front of you. It takes less effort. If you are trying to focus on a subtle mental thread, allowing yourself to be distracted is like stopping pain to enjoy a mild pleasure: it’s too hard to resist! Blocking out external distractions altogether, especially if you get a lot of them, seems to be one of the best strategies for improving mental performance. ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=885))
- The mind likes to wander, like a young puppy sniffing around here and there. As frustrating as this tendency can be, it’s normal. One reason for your wandering attention is that the nervous system is constantly processing, reconfiguring, and reconnecting the trillions of connections in your brain each moment. The term for this is ambient neural activity. ([Location 892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=892))
- we are the descendants of people who paid a lot of attention when there was a rustle in the bushes. A new shape of car, a flash of light, an odd sound underfoot, or a strange smell—all get our attention because they stand out, because they are novel. ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=922))
- Most motor or mental acts also generate their own momentum. ([Location 994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=994))
- If you have language to describe the feeling of having too much on your stage at once, you will be more likely to notice it. In some ways this whole book is about helping you develop explicit language maps within the prefrontal cortex for experiences that until now have occurred only implicitly. ([Location 1012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1012))
- Each time you inhibit something, your ability to inhibit again is reduced. ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1048))
- When Paul first drove off, he suffered from the rare phenomenon of being too happy on the job. He was feeling so good he forgot to create and hold an image in mind of where he was going. ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1093))
- You can play various “tricks” on yourself to generate the release of this chemical. Visualizing an activity generates a similar metabolic response to actually doing it. One study found that picturing yourself doing a finger exercise increased muscle mass by 22 percent, which was close to the 30 percent achieved by doing the exercise for real. ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1135))
- Where norepinephrine is the chemistry of alertness, dopamine is the chemistry of interest. Good levels of both chemicals are required to generate the right level of arousal, but each chemical has a different impact on its own. Dopamine is released in a number of situations. First, the dopamine level rises when the orbital frontal cortex detects novelty, something unexpected or new. ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1149))
- Paul could improve his focus by changing simple aspects of how he works. Just changing the height of his chair could be enough of a fresh perspective to ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1156))
- Scientists have also found that expecting a positive event, anything the brain perceives as a reward, generates dopamine. Rewards to the brain include food, sex, money, and positive social interactions. So Paul could have put his prefrontal cortex into the right neurochemical sweet spot by focusing on the possible rewards of his doing a great job on this proposal, the money he could win, and the future rewards that would come his way. ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1159))
- Ohlsson explains how when facing a new problem, people apply strategies that worked in prior experiences. This works well if a new problem is similar to an old problem. However, in many situations this is not the case, and the solution from the past gets in the way, stopping better solutions from arising. The incorrect strategy becomes the source of the impasse. ([Location 1337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1337))
- Other than taking that career-risking stroll, what else can you do to have more insights? Beeman’s research provides clues. He found that people who solved a problem with insight had more activation of a brain region called the right anterior temporal lobe, a region underneath the right ear. This area allows you to pull together distantly related information. It is part of the right hemisphere, the hemisphere more related to holistic connections. Jonathan Schooler showed that when people focus on the details of a scene instead of the big picture, they disrupt the insight process, by shifting their brain into left-hemisphere mode. ([Location 1376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1376))
- ARIA stands for Awareness, Reflection, Insight, and Action. The model both describes the stages of an insight, so you can recognize the process in real time, and provides practical techniques for increasing the likelihood of insight. ([Location 1411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1411))
- In the reflection phase, you hold the impasse in mind, but reflect on your thinking processes, rather than on the content of thoughts. ([Location 1418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1418))
- To be effective at work I have proposed that you need to get a minimum of actors on the stage, in the right order, a few at a time, with the right level of arousal. Yet now I am suggesting that sometimes you have to get everyone off the stage, so that unconscious processes can solve the problem. ([Location 1465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1465))
- The technical term many neuroscientists ascribe to the concept of the director is mindfulness. ([Location 1530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1530))
- They discovered that people have two distinct ways of interacting with the world, using two different sets of maps. ([Location 1572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1572))
- The Farb study shows there is a whole other way of experiencing experience. Scientists call this type of experience direct experience. When the direct-experience network is active, several different brain regions become more active. ([Location 1589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1589))
- Mindfulness isn’t difficult. What’s difficult is to remember to be mindful.” ([Location 1652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1652))
- When the limbic system gets overly aroused, it reduces the resources available for prefrontal cortex functions. ([Location 1792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1792))
- When there are not enough resources for conscious processing, the brain becomes more “automatic,” drawing on either deeply embedded functions or ideas close to the front of your audience, such as recent events. ([Location 1806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1806))
- He explains that before an emotion arises, there are several choices to be made: situation selection, situation modification, and attention deployment. ([Location 1848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1848))
- Trying to suppress the expression of an emotion takes a lot of cognitive resources, which leaves fewer resources for paying attention to the moment. ([Location 1872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1872))
- When your limbic system becomes aroused, the resources available for your prefrontal cortex decrease. However, this works the other way, too. Increasing the arousal of the prefrontal cortex can dampen down the arousal of your limbic system. The two work like a seesaw. You can make this switch happen by trying to find the right word to identify an emotional sensation, a technique that is called symbolic labeling. ([Location 1883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1883))
- Because people incorrectly predict that voicing their feelings will make those feelings worse, a lot of people, especially in the business world, don’t discuss their feelings. This is an example of humans developing some unfortunate habits from incorrect assumptions about human nature. ([Location 1901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1901))
- Here’s the bottom line: describe an emotion in just a word or two, and it helps reduce the emotion. Open up a dialogue about an emotion, though, and you tend to increase it. ([Location 1906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1906))
- Use your director to observe your emotional state. Be conscious of things that may increase limbic system arousal and work out ways to reduce these, before the arousal kicks in. Practice noticing emotions as they arise, to get better at sensing their presence earlier. When you sense a strong emotion coming on, refocus your attention quickly on another stimulus, before the emotion takes over. Practice assigning words to emotional states to reduce arousal once it kicks in. ([Location 1971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=1971))
- This experience is one of finding a choice and making that choice, and it shifts what and how I perceive in that moment. ([Location 2093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2093))
- someone who has become a paraplegic is just as happy as someone who’s won the lottery. It seems clear people are doing something to find what’s positive in even the most dire of circumstances. The one thing you can always do is control your interpretation of the meaning of the situation, ([Location 2105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2105))
- Having an explanation for an experience reduces uncertainty and increases a perception of control. The field of change management builds on the power of normalizing, by describing the emotions and stages that occur during change, such as denial or anger, to help people reduce the threat response. ([Location 2137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2137))
- By looking afresh at the values she ascribes to situations, Emily might find a way to put a positive spin on working with others, to raise the value of this idea. ([Location 2146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2146))
- Each of these four types of reappraisal—reinterpreting, normalizing, reordering, and repositioning—are techniques people use all the time. ([Location 2158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2158))
- “If our emotional responses fundamentally flow out of interpretations, or appraisals, of the world, and we can change those appraisals, then we have to try and do so. And to not do so, at some level, is rather irresponsible.” Let’s ([Location 2173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2173))
- Let’s take this to another level. Frustration at your limitations, mistakes, missed opportunities, forgetfulness, or bad habits can generate a lot of limbic activity. A common automatic response when people get annoyed with themselves is to try to suppress this feeling, to push aside the internal frustration. But you now know what suppression can do for emotions. ([Location 2232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2232))
- teachers know that kids learn best when they are interested in a subject. Interest, desire, and positive expectations are slight variations on a similar experience, the experience of having an increased level of dopamine in the brain. ([Location 2416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2416))
- “Four out of five processes operating in the background when your brain is at rest involve thinking about other people and yourself.” ([Location 2570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2570))
- Without his face and body language visible, everyone misread his intent. People on the call were not connecting the way the brain is best at connecting, which involves being able to copy other people’s emotional states and intents directly. The way the brain does this is through mirror neurons. ([Location 2604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2604))
- “What happens is that when we witness others’ facial expressions, we activate the same in our own motor cortex, but we also transmit this information to the insula, involved in our emotions. When I see your facial expression, I get the movement of your face, which drives the same motor response on my face, so a smile gets a smile. The motor resonance is also sent on to your own emotional centers, so you share the emotion of the person in front of you.” ([Location 2619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2619))
- Here’s one big reason collaboration is difficult: just as the brain automatically classifies any situation into a possible reward or threat, it does the same with people, determining, subconsciously, whether each person you meet is either a friend or foe. ([Location 2650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2650))
- Oxytocin is released when two people dance together, play music together, or engage in a collaborative conversation. It’s the neurochemistry of safe connectivity. ([Location 2662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2662))
- The one thing that makes people happy is the quality and quantity of their social connections. ([Location 2671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2671))
- Having friends helps you change your brain, because you get to speak out loud more often. One experiment showed that when people repeated out loud what they were learning, the speed of their learning and their ability to apply that learning to other situations increased. ([Location 2692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2692))
- Deciding someone is a foe means you make accidental connections, misread intent, get easily upset, and discard their good ideas. ([Location 2716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2716))
- One interesting implication of fairness research is the idea that workplaces that truly allow employees to experience an increasing perception of fairness might be intrinsically rewarding. This may explain why people perform better in certain workplace cultures. ([Location 2914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=2914))
- Because of the intensity of the status-drop experience, many people go to great lengths to avoid situations that could put their status at risk. This aversion includes staying away from any activity they are not confident in, which, because of the brain’s relationship to novelty, can mean avoiding anything new. This can have quite an impact on the quality of life. This is Gross’s situation selection working against you. With the threat ([Location 3116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=3116))
- The threat response from a perceived drop in status can take on a life of its own, lasting for years. People work hard to avoid being “wrong” in a situation, from a simple mistake made on a document, to an error in judgment about a major strategy. ([Location 3127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=3127))
- sometimes even life itself. As well as sometimes taking on a life of their own, the other trouble with status threats is how easily they can occur, generating a strong threat even in minor situations. Say you are at a meeting with a colleague, and for the first time in your working relationship, he asks to follow up with you about a project. It’s likely you will interpret his request as a threat to your status: Doesn’t he trust you? Is he checking up on you? Your threat response could make you say something harmful to your career. Remember that the limbic system, once ([Location 3134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=3134))
- I recently interviewed an international ballet dancer who used to be a member of the London Royal Ballet. She told me how she was often bored and frustrated as one of many dancers, even though she was in a world-class troupe. That all changed when she moved to a smaller, less known troupe in her home city, and now was the leading soloist. ([Location 3144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=3144))
- Maintaining high status is something that the brain seems to work on all the time subconsciously. You can elevate your status by finding a way to feel smarter, funnier, healthier, richer, more righteous, more organized, fitter, or stronger, or by beating other people at just about anything at all. ([Location 3170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=3170))
- If you want to have a potentially threatening conversation with someone, try talking down your own performance to help put the other person at ease. It didn’t work for Emily with Colin, but it can sometimes be helpful. Being brought down off a pedestal in someone’s mind may reduce his threat level. ([Location 3182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=3182))
- there are five domains of social experience that your brain treats the same as survival issues. These domains form a model, which I call the SCARF model, which stands for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness. ([Location 3212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=3212))
- He tries to understand the source of Eric’s problem, and then makes suggestions. I call this approach the default approach to helping people. What Paul doesn’t realize is that this default approach is inefficient for solving human problems, and even has some undesirable side effects. ([Location 3342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=3342))
- Ohlsson set up situations where people had impasses and then tried two techniques: giving other people clues about what not to think about, and giving clues about what they should think about. “The effects of these strategies are negligible,” ([Location 3454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002Q1YE3K&location=3454))
- SCARF model. You could help the person increase her sense of status, perhaps by encouraging her. Or increase someone’s sense of certainty by making implicit issues more explicit, say, by clarifying your objectives.
