- we are, in our essential state, pure consciousness. Pure consciousness is pure potentiality; it is the field of all possibilities and infinite creativity. (Page 7)
- Our essential nature is one of pure potentiality. (Page 7)
- The Law of Pure Potentiality could also be called the Law of Unity, because underlying the infinite diversity of life is the unity of one allpervasive spirit (Page 7)
- There is no separation between you and this field of energy. The field of pure potentiality is your own Se (Page 7)
- experience of the Self, or (cid:147)self-referral,(cid:148) means that our internal reference point is our own spirit, and not the objects of our experience (Page 7)
- The experience of the Self, or (cid:147)self-referral,(cid:148) means that our internal reference point is our own spirit, and not the objects of our experience. (Page 7)
- object-referral we are constantly seeking the approval of others. Our thinking and our behaviour are always in anticipation of a response. It is therefore fear-based. (Page 7)
- object-referral we also feel an intense need to control things. We feel an intense need for external power. The need for approval, the need to control things, and the need for external power are needs that are based on fear (Page 7)
- It draws people to you, and it also draws things that you want to you. It magnetizes people, situations, and circumstances to support your desires (Page 8)

- to access the field is through the daily practice of silence, meditation, and non-judgment. Spending time in nature will also give you access to the qualities inherent in the field: infinite creativity, freedom, and bliss. (Page 8)
- Practicing silence means making a commitment to take a certain amount of time to simply Be. Experiencing silence means periodically withdrawing from the activity of speech. It also means periodically withdrawing from such activities as watching television, listening to the radio, or reading a book. If you never give yourself the opportunity to experience silence, this creates turbulence in your internal dialogue. (Page 8)
- What happens when you go into this experience of silence? Initially your internal dialogue becomes even more turbulent. You feel an intense need to say things. I(cid:146)ve known people who go absolutely crazy the first day or two when they commit themselves to an extended period of silence. A sense of urgency and anxiety suddenly comes over them. But as they stay with the experience, their internal dialogue begins to quieten. And soon the silence becomes profound. This is because after a while the mind gives up; it realizes there is no point in going around and around if you (cid:151) the Self, the spirit, the choice-maker (cid:151) are not going to speak, period. Then, as the internal dialogue quietens, you begin to experience the stillness of the field of pure potentiality. (Page 8)
- In the fifth spiritual law, the Law of Intention and Desire, you will see how you can introduce a faint impulse of intention in this field, and the creation of your desires will come about spontaneously. But first, you have to experience stillness. Stillness is the first requirement for manifestin (Page 9)
- You must learn to get in touch with the innermost essence of your being. This true essence is beyond the ego. It is fearless; it is free; it is immune to criticism; it does not fear any challenge. It is beneath no one, superior to no one, and full of magic, mystery, and enchantment. (Page 9)
