- The objective of this paper is to provide a novel methodology for the management of design in complex change initiatives. To do so, we bring together approaches from program and evaluation, systems thinking, and graph theory. I ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtvjfewwfgrtzcha3r3f5mh))
- Users of ToCs often model them as logic models, such as “outcome chains” (Funnel & Rogers, 2011, pp. 176–195) or “so that chains” ("Theory of Change: A Practical Tool," 2004), where the desired goal is at the end of the chain and the outcomes that lead to it precede from it (Funnel & Rogers, 2011, p. 176).2 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtvkbebw2aw48gzyemvek36))
- “Theory of change was original y developed to model and evaluate complex change initiatives, so it is clearly related to systems change” (Abercrombie et al., 2018, p. 5).
  They describe five pitfal s of ToC in systems change work. ToCs can cause leaders to neglect context, ignore their responsibility to change, maintain linear cause-effect thinking, protect their plans instead of adapting to change, and frame change as technical sets of inputs and outputs rather than driven by people as relationships (Abercrombie et al., 2018, p. 5). In turn, they provide five rules of thumb inspired by systems thinking that respond to these pitfal s (Abercrombie et al., 2018, p. 6).

- The technique reveals features of the focal system that designers must further investigate through systems and design research. The results of the analysis should be interrogated and vetted by system stakeholders before acting upon them. For instance, designers may present the initial results of leverage analysis to stakeholders for critique ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtvzdw5agjm8kzgfk2cq6vz))

- In this paper, we showed how a novel approach to understanding the structure of complex problems—leverage analysis—could be applied to a CLD to develop a SToC. We believe this approach is powerful, making it easier to identify systemic change sub-theories in the most complex of CLDs. In turn, designers can compose several such wel -aligned sub-theories into a theory of change for the management of their designed interventions.
  We believe, however, that our present implementation is rudimentary. The process we have defined does not take advantage of al of the features of leverage analysis (namely the elements of structural dominance, such as level and cycle partitions; Murphy & Jones, 2020). The process also does not intentional y account for feedback loops or systems archetypes (Braun, 2002). In the future, we hope that this technique is advanced further to include these aspects of systems structure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtw4xzrq9160v4nk90nrrg1))
