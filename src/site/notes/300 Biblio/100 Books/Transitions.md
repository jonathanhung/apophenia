- Transitional situations bring this paradox to the surface and force us to look at negative and positive aspects of our life situations. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=250))
- That is interesting because most of us think we ought to “take charge” of our lives and “plan carefully” when we’re trying to start again after an ending. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=309))
- The point is that Joanna and I (and quite possibly you) had a memorable transition experience around the end of childhood, and that experience was established in our awareness as a model for subsequent life transitions. Because we lack formal rites of passage and guidance in these matters, it is not surprising that the basic form of that experience or elements from it may reappear later in our lives. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=505))
- The early place finders may later regret that they did not try different options before making long-term commitments, and the experimenters may wonder whether they waited too long and missed some hidden moment when settling down would have felt just right and would have worked. Both groups tend to find themselves asking these questions as they approach thirty. Levinson calls this time the “age thirty transition”; Gould emphasizes a growing realism about oneself and calls it a time of “opening up to what’s inside.”3 Either way, the approaching thirtieth birthday seems to inspire second thoughts. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=552))
- he calls the years from twenty-two to thirty-three the “novice period” of adulthood. Perhaps it would be better if we viewed thirty rather than twenty-one as the first great watershed of the lifetime; or, better yet, if we viewed the end of childhood, the time of being on one’s own, the search for a place and the time of second thoughts, as a series of times during which transitions accomplish the larger developmental business of transforming us from dependency to independence. ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=580))
- The thirties can be a time of new or renewed commitment to what Levinson calls “the tribe,” some social grouping that has particular importance for the individual. This can be a formal organization or a profession, the community where one lives or an ethnic population of which one is a part, or “men” or “women” or “the working class,” or even “humankind.” ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=602))
- Relationships are always structured by unspoken agreements, although people are seldom conscious of it. Beginning very early there is a psychological division of labor within a relationship: One person takes care of the practical issues and the other handles the human ones; or one expresses emotions and the other anchors the relationship in practical ways; or one is full of plans and the other is the tough critic. ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=985))
- After a few years of that, the two are polarized with the role-enabled side of each personality artificially amplified by the arrangement. Each of them becomes a less-than-whole person, and each becomes a stand in for the side of the other’s personality that is not being expressed within the relationship. He’s not just a rational guy. He becomes the substitute for her rationality. ([Location 989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=989))
- Rather, we are more like stories that are slowly unfolding according to our own preestablished inner themes and plots. Each person’s life is a story that is telling itself in the living of it, and each requires others to play certain kinds of roles. (Wanted: A warm, unassertive woman to soothe a middle-aged and rapidly tiring knight on a decrepit horse.) Each of us resists transition because a story is a self-coherent world with its own kind of immune system, and alien characters are out of place. ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1001))
- A couple can find lots of help on how they ought to be: less sexist, say, or more open in their communication, or more accepting of each other. But they will have a far harder time finding help with the issue of how to change or how to let each other change within a relationship. This is unfortunate because in such a situation not only the relationship is at stake but also the ongoing growth of each partner individually. ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1014))
- Whatever the current antagonisms and topics that a couple is trying to deal with, a life transition brings them to the point where each party has the opportunity to discover new inner resources that have hitherto been lived out mainly through the other person. Each of them has the opportunity to come out of the transition as a more whole, more complete person. Their relationship can then be renegotiated on a less restrictive basis. ([Location 1019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1019))
- This process of renegotiation must take place many times during a long-term relationship if it is to stay vital and provide both partners with the setting for their continued development. ([Location 1022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1022))
- the process is greatly facilitated by the recognition that a relationship, like the lives that come together to form it, has its seasons and its times of turning. Problems, in that view, are not malfunctions to be solved or flaws to be corrected; they are the signals that a chapter in the joint story has ended. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1026))
- More often than not, it turns out that the ending is not some external situation but an attitude or an assumption or a self-image that both partners have held. And the husbands or wives who were sure that their partners needed help find that the need is within themselves, that once the inner change is made by them, the other person proves to be not nearly so blind or unwilling to talk. ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1036))
- Sometimes, the shifts from one to the other are subtle and gradual; at other times, they are explosive: “That’s it! I’m done with your something-or-other.” But however they occur, the shifts are major transitions in the life of the relationship. Each time, both parties have to let go of how things used to be, go through a confusing neutral zone during which a new agreement is forged, and then launch the beginning of some new way of being together. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1053))
- What is happening is that in ending and letting go of what you have been—which starts the transition process—you lose your old connections to the activities and the people that used to matter to you. In the turning cycle of change, this is the fall; attempts to reinstate your old motivations by reward or punishment are as futile as trying to keep leaves on the trees once they’ve started to fall. ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1215))
- What is it time to let go of in my own life right now? This question marks the first difference between change and transition, for the latter must start with letting go. As we noted in “A Lifetime of Transitions,” we periodically reach the point where an attitude, a belief, a style of responding to challenges, a goal or a dream for the future, or an assumption about others—that served us well up to that time—simply isn’t what we need for the future. ([Location 1257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1257))
- 2. What is standing backstage, in the wings of my life, waiting to make its entrance? The answer is something internal, something subjective, although it may be presented to you as an external event or situation that brings it to your attention. ([Location 1269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1269))
- Elders are not supposed to inundate the young with truisms that too often pass for wisdom; they must show the young how to distill wisdom from their own experiences. ([Location 1392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1392))
- being in transition means that something more than that is going on inwardly. It means that you have reached the point where it is time to let go of an idea or an assumption, a self-image or a dream. It means that you are moving from one chapter of your story to the next. Although that might involve being in between jobs, that is not the same as being in transition. A transition concludes when something new emerges from your own inner neutral zone, something around which you can build your new life. ([Location 1409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1409))
- They are not techniques for doing something but lenses through which to magnify the experience of something. Rituals of passage are simply a way of focusing and making more visible the natural pattern of dying, chaos, and renewal that was believed to operate everywhere in the universe. ([Location 1493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1493))
- All that good advice she kept asking for was beside the point, for her real need then was to find out how to let the person-that-she-had-been die and go through a renewal process. ([Location 1540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1540))
- Getting unplugged from your old place in the interpersonal and social world that gave you an identity is where the transition process starts, but disengagement only stops the old signals and cues from being received. It leaves untouched the life infrastructure that you’ve constructed in response to those signals. ([Location 1598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1598))
- you do these things, you slowly dismantle or unpack your relationship to the person, or the relationship or identity that you have lost. ([Location 1612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1612))
- for with realities as with identities and connections, the old must be cleared away before the new can grow. The mind is a vessel that must be emptied if new wine is to be put in. ([Location 1680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1680))
- This process is hard to take in more than just a natural, personal sense; it goes against the grain of our culture, which tends to view growth as an additive process. We did not have to unlearn the first grade to go on to the second, for example, or forget Sunday school when we joined the church. We do not expect to give up old beliefs (in spite of St. Paul’s injunction to “put away childish things”) in order to mature. ([Location 1681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1681))
- He found that the first task of transition was unlearning, not learning anew. ([Location 1688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1688))
- must realize that some significant part of your old reality was in your head, not out there. The ([Location 1690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1690))
- the disillusioned person simply rejects the embodiment of the earlier view; she finds a new husband or he gets a new boss, but both leave unchanged the old enchanted view of relationships. The disenchanted person moves on, but the disillusioned person stops and goes through the play again with new actors. Such a person is on a perpetual quest for a real friend, a true mate, and a trustworthy leader. ([Location 1706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1706))
- The problem is that before we can find a new something, we must deal with a time of nothingness. And that prospect awakens old fears and all the old fantasies about death and abandonment. ([Location 1739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1739))
- The goal of one phase of life becomes the burden of the next. That is why rites of passage begin with a symbolic death. Without that death, the life becomes “polluted,” as the oracle said the city of Thebes had become. ([Location 1798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1798))
- One of the most important differences between a change and a transition is that changes are driven to reach a goal, but transitions start with letting go of what no longer fits or is adequate to the life stage you are in. You need to figure out for yourself what exactly that no-longer-appropriate thing is. There’s no list in the back of the book. But there is a hint that can save you considerable pain and remorse: Whatever it is, it is internal. ([Location 1809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1809))
- In taking the initiate into the wilderness and enervating him or her with fasting and fatigue, in suppressing the initiate’s old consciousness with chanting and rhythmical movements, in enlivening the imagination with mythic tales and symbolic procedures of various sorts—in all these ways, traditional societies opened the person to the transformative experiences of the neutral zone. ([Location 1939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1939))
- It is tempting to think that we could recover and re-animate lost rituals, but that seldom works very well. Rather, we need to understand which neutral zone activities the old rituals were designed to facilitate and then discover our own ways of doing those things. ([Location 1968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1968))
- The first of the neutral zone activities or functions is surrender —one must give in to the emptiness and stop struggling ([Location 1970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=1970))
- anxious about the transition they are in—fall into when they are in the neutral zone. Let’s call them the traps of fast forward and reverse. ([Location 2005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=2005))
- Think of what would be unlived in your life if it ended today. ([Location 2096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=2096))
- Do what you do attentively rather than distractedly while you wait for the real experience to come along. Making tea and putting on your shoes and watching a bird on the bush outside the window are the real experiences. Every detail is worth noticing—each is a note in the great symphony of peep-toot-and-boom. ([Location 2120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZY23TS&location=2120))
