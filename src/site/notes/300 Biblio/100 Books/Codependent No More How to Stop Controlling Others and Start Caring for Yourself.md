- WHAT’S CODEPENDENCY?
  I have heard and read many definitions of codependency.
  In an article from the book *Co-Dependency, An Emerging Issue,* Robert Subby wrote codependency is “an emotional, psychological, and behavioral condition that develops as a result of an individual’s prolonged exposure to, and practice of, a set of oppressive rules—rules which prevent the open expression of feeling as well as the direct discussion of personal and interpersonal problems.”[2](#c03-ftn2)
  Earnie Larsen, another codependency specialist and a pioneer in that field, defines codependency as “those self-defeating, learned behaviors or character defects that result in a diminished capacity to initiate or to participate in loving relationships.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdzmrmxhvhnyjnqqqc0db9e))
- One fairly common denominator was having a relationship, personally or professionally, with troubled, needy, or dependent people. But a second, more common denominator seemed to be the unwritten, silent rules that usually develop in the immediate family and set the pace for relationships.[8](#c03-ftn8) These rules prohibit discussion about problems; open expression of feelings; direct, honest communication; realistic expectations, such as being human, vulnerable, or imperfect; selfishness; trust in other people and one’s self; playing and having fun; and rocking the delicately balanced family canoe through growth or change—however healthy and beneficial that movement might be. These rules are common to alcoholic family systems but can emerge in other families, too. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdzr4q5y9vknh3wkss0t2t4))
- So, here is my definition of a codependent:
  A *codependent person is one who has let another person’s behavior affect him or her, and who is obsessed with controlling that person’s behavior.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdzrhtn3pj5q4yqecvqn5qh))
- But, the heart of the definition and recovery lies not in the *other person*—no matter how much we believe it does. It lies in ourselves, in the ways we have let other people’s behavior affect us and in the ways we try to affect them: the obsessing, the controlling, the obsessive “helping,” caretaking, low self-worth bordering on self-hatred, self-repression, abundance of anger and guilt, peculiar dependency on peculiar people, attraction to and tolerance for the bizarre, other-centeredness that results in abandonment of self, communication problems, intimacy problems, and an ongoing whirlwind trip through the five-stage grief process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdzxkdm1ytsj36mb8xhejj6))
- Codependents want to help. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gge09yewnmd1kfpj74ffdwfj))
- Codependents are reactionaries. They overreact. They under-react. But rarely do they *act.* They react to the problems, pains, lives, and behaviors of others ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gge0ba7cpkt2kpkbwq6qwsnn))
- *Codependents may:*

- feel compelled—almost forced—to help that person solve the problem, such as offering unwanted advice, giving a rapid-fire series of suggestions, or fixing feelings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gge0fhhpgmg6szghj6w82tns))

- We cannot begin to work on ourselves, to live our own lives, feel our own feelings, and solve our own problems until we have detached from the object of our obsession. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gge120rqkye9mhgmxnp8720d))
- Most codependents are attached to the people and problems in their environments. By “attachment,” I don’t mean normal feelings of liking people, being concerned about problems, or feeling connected to the world. Attachment is becoming overly-involved, sometimes hopelessly entangled.
  Attachment can take several forms:
  • We may become excessively worried about, and preoccupied with, a problem or person (our mental energy is attached).
  • Or, we may graduate to becoming obsessed with and controlling of the people and problems in our environment (our mental, physical, and emotional energy is directed at the object of our obsession).
  • We may become reactionaries, instead of acting authentically of our own volition (our mental, emotional, and physical energy is attached).
  • We may become emotionally dependent on the people around us (now we’re really attached).
  • We may become caretakers (rescuers, enablers) to the people around us (firmly attaching ourselves to their need for us).
  The problems with attachment are many. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gge199sgy0pkqr4rns6a8gyz))
    - Note: this is a weird model for attachment and stimgatizes or problematizes normal relational bonds. Where is the line drawn? It's not like I'm concerned or want to control you or anxiously pre-occupied about you. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Most codependents are reactionaries. We react with anger, guilt, shame, self-hate, worry, hurt, controlling gestures, caretaking acts, depression, desperation, and fury. *We react with fear and anxiety.* Some of us react so much it is painful to be around people, and torturous to be in large groups of people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gge1f8npdnqrq7xw1gx3rmbc))
- WE JUMP INTO THE FIRST FEELING THAT COMES OUR WAY AND THEN WALLOW IN IT. We think the first thought that comes into our heads and then elaborate on it. We say the first words on our tongues and sometimes regret them. We do the first thing that comes to mind, usually without thinking about it. That is the problem: we are reacting without thinking—without honest thought about what we need to do, and how we want to handle the situation.
