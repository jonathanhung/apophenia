- As divinity separated from nature, so also it became unholy to involve oneself too deeply in the affairs of the world. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=160))
- Paradoxically, this separate, abstract thing called spirit is supposed to be what animates the world. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=165))
    - Note: alan watts [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- It is hugely ironic and hugely significant that the one thing on the planet most closely resembling the forgoing conception of the divine is money. It is an invisible, immortal force that surrounds and steers all things, omnipotent and limitless, an “invisible hand” that, it is said, makes the world go ’round. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=172))
- Money’s divine property of abstraction, ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=180))
    - Note: and desigm and tech does the same. playing gods [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- What we call recession, an earlier culture might have called “God abandoning the world.” ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=188))
    - Note: drought or plague or lack of economic activity [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- So when I speak of making money sacred, I am not invoking a supernatural agency to infuse sacredness into the inert, mundane objects of nature. I am rather reaching back to an earlier time, a time before the divorce of matter and spirit, when sacredness was endemic to all things. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=199))
- And what is the sacred? It has two aspects: uniqueness and relatedness. A sacred object or being is one that is special, unique, one of a kind. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=202))
- Today we live in a world that has been shorn of its sacredness, so that very few things indeed give us the feeling of living in a sacred world. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=209))
- What is the difference between a supermarket tomato and one grown in my neighbor’s garden and given to me? ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=218))
- That is why reductionist science seems to rob the world of its sacredness, since everything becomes one or another combination of a handful of generic building blocks. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=235))
- Tribal peoples saw each being not primarily as a member of a category, but as a unique, enspirited individual. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=238))
- Here was the link between the two qualities of the sacred, connectedness and uniqueness: unique objects retain the mark of their origin, their unique place in the great matrix of being, their dependency on the rest of creation for their existence. Standardized objects, commodities, are uniform and therefore disembedded from relationship. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=240))
- Within every institution of our civilization, no matter how ugly or corrupt, there is the germ of something beautiful: the same note at a higher octave. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=246))
- THE ECONOMICS OF SEPARATION ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=280))
- the story of Ascent: ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=288))
- Money is a system of social agreements, meanings, and symbols that develops over time. It is, in a word, a story, existing in social reality ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=291))
- In the beginning was the Gift: ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=333))
- Gratitude therefore is natural to us, ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=334))
- Today’s economic system rewards selfishness and greed. What would an economic system look like that, like some ancient cultures, rewarded generosity instead? ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=342))
- Circulation is a better word. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=345))
- While gifts can be reciprocal, just as often they flow in circles. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=349))
- other words, gifts flow continuously, only stopping in their circulation when they meet a real, present need. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=362))
- The gift moves toward the empty place. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=364))
- You probably have some treasured items that were given you, that are perhaps objectively indistinguishable from something you might buy, but that are unique and special because of who gave them to you. ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=381))
- gifts are unique to the extent that they partake of the giver. Second, wholeness, interdependency: gifts expand the circle of self to include the entire community. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=395))
- That we are indeed here on earth to do something is essentially a religious concept, for conventional biology teaches that we have evolved to be able to survive, that any effort toward something outside of survival and reproduction goes against our genetic programming. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=482))
- However, one can make a cogent neo-Lamarckian case that the view of biology as consisting of myriad discrete, separate competing selves—organisms or “selfish genes”—is more a projection of our own present-day culture than it is an accurate understanding of nature.13 ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=483))
- through with the struggle to be good, and through with the pretense that I was any better than anyone else. I believe humanity, collectively, is nearing such a time as well. Ultimately, greed is a red herring, itself a symptom and not a cause of a deeper problem. To blame greed and to fight it by intensifying the program of self-control is to intensify the war against the self, which is just another expression of the war against nature and the war against the other that lies at the base of the present crisis of civilization. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=575))
- According to a government study, farm-to-retail losses are about 4 percent, retail-to-consumer losses 12 percent, and consumer-level losses 29 percent. ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=626))
- we must be cautious in our indignation at such facts as, “Over two billion people live on less than two dollars a day.” ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=686))
- When everything is subject to money, then the scarcity of money makes everything scarce, including the basis of human life and happiness. ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=692))
- We live in an abundant world, made otherwise through our perceptions, our culture, and our deep invisible stories. ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=719))
- On a deep level, money and consciousness are intertwined. Each is bound up in the other. ([Location 831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=831))
- Moreover, the homogeneity of money accompanied the rapid development of standardized commodity goods for trade. Such standardization was crude in preindustrial times, but today manufactured objects are so nearly identical as to make the lie of money into the truth. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=837))
- Today we suffer a poverty of immeasurable things, priceless things; a poverty of the things that money cannot buy and a surfeit of the things it can (though this surfeit is so unequally distributed that many suffer a poverty of those things, too). ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=844))
- Just as money homogenizes the things it touches, so also does it homogenize and depersonalize its users: ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=847))
- “Stripped of all personal association, money is promiscuous, capable of being exchanged with anybody for anything, indifferent to all nonmonetary interpersonal relationships.” ([Location 854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=854))
- Wisely, perhaps, many people refuse on principle to mix business with friendship, wary of the essential conflict between money and personal relationship. Money depersonalizes a relationship, turning two people into mere “parties to an exchange” driven by the universal goal of maximizing self-interest. ([Location 859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=859))
- “In the empires of usury the sentimentality of the man with the soft heart calls to us because it speaks of what has been lost.” ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=873))
- Like wealth, enlightenment is a goal that knows no limit, and in both cases the pursuit of it can enslave. ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=894))
- Originally, land rights were almost always held in common, accruing to the village or tribe, and not the individual. ([Location 1066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1066))
- private property is but a symptom of a deeper malady (Separation), and if we address that symptom from the mind-set of Separation, of conquest, of overcoming evil, we will end up with the same iniquities in different forms. Finally, even on the economic level, the problem is not private property per se, but the unfair advantages of owning it. ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1102))
- We need an economic system that disallows profit-by-owning yet rewards the entrepreneur’s spirit that says, “I know a way to use it better,” and allows that spirit free rein. ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1106))
- Why should someone profit from the use-value of land by the mere fact of owning it, especially when the origin of that ownership is based on ancient injustice? ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1181))
- Silvio Gesell, proposed a near-equivalent to George’s land tax: the public ownership of all land, available for private leasing ([Location 1190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1190))
- The earth belongs to, and is an organic part of man. We cannot conceive man without the earth any more than without a head or a stomach. The earth is just as much a part, an organ, of man as his head. ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1196))
- We drove for an hour, but we never did find a field or forest that wasn’t festooned with “No Trespassing” signs. Every time I see one I feel a twinge, a loss. Any squirrel is freer than I am, any deer. These signs apply to humans only. ([Location 1214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1214))
- After three hundred years of economic expansion, we are so impoverished that we lack the wealth and freedom of a squirrel. The indigenous people who lived here before the Europeans arrived had the run of the land. They had the simple freedom to say, “Let us climb that mountain. Let us swim in that lake. Let us fish that river.” Not even the wealthiest among us have that freedom today. ([Location 1222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1222))
- Money is the corpse of the commons, the embodiment of all that was once common and free, turned now into property of the purest form. ([Location 1253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1253))
- In the Middle Ages, minstrels would listen to each other’s songs and borrow new tunes that they liked, modify them, and circulate them back into the commons of music. ([Location 1333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1333))
- Social capital refers primarily to relationships and skills, the “services” that people once provided for themselves and each other in a gift economy, such as cooking, child care, health care, hospitality, entertainment, advice, and the growing of food, making of clothes, and building of houses. ([Location 1391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1391))
- In general, the fine division of labor that accompanies technology has made us dependent on strangers for most of the things we use, and makes it unlikely that our neighbors depend on us for anything we produce. ([Location 1398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1398))
- the same principle is fast creating a global monoculture where every service is a paid service. When money mediates all our relationships, we too lose our uniqueness to become a standard consumer of standard goods and services, and a standard functionary performing other services. No personal economic relationships are important because we can always “pay someone else to do it.” No wonder, strive as we might, we find it so hard to create community. No wonder we feel so insecure, so replaceable. ([Location 1403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1403))
- The necessities of life have been given over to specialists, leaving us with nothing meaningful to do (outside our own area of expertise) but to entertain ourselves. Meanwhile, whatever functions of daily living that remain to us are mostly solitary functions: driving places, buying things, paying bills, cooking convenience foods, doing housework. None of these demand the help of neighbors, relatives, or friends. We wish we were closer to our neighbors; we think of ourselves as friendly people who would gladly help them. But there is little to help them with. In our house-boxes, we are self-sufficient. Or rather, we are self-sufficient in relation to the people we know but dependent as never before on total strangers living thousands of miles away. ([Location 1415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1415))
- Community and intimacy cannot come from joint consumption, but only from giving and cocreativity. ([Location 1424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1424))
- Very important needs go unmet today, and money, because of its impersonal nature, is incapable of meeting them. The community of the future will arise from the needs that money inherently cannot meet. ([Location 1438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1438))
- On a deep level, though, the human needs these things meet are nothing new. They just meet them in a different way—a way that we must now pay for. Consider telecommunications. Human beings do not have an abstract need for long-distance communication. We have a need to stay in contact with people with whom we share emotional and economic ties. ([Location 1448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1448))
- One of the two primary assumptions of economics is that human beings normally act in their rational self-interest and that this self-interest corresponds to money. Two people will only make an exchange (e.g., buying something for money) if it benefits both to do so. ([Location 1490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1490))
- If I babysit your children for free, economists don’t count it as a service or add it to GDP. It cannot be used to pay a financial debt; nor can I go to the supermarket and say, “I watched my neighbors’ kids this morning, so please give me food.” But if I open a day care center and charge you money, I have created a “service.” ([Location 1507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1507))
- But all this efficiency has neither given us more leisure nor met any fundamentally new need. The efficiency ends up meeting the old needs in endless, obscene elaboration, eventually reaching the extreme of closets full of clothes and shoes that are barely worn before entering the landfill. ([Location 1524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1524))
- desire for personal exculpation from the sins of society is a kind of fetish, akin to solar panels on a 4,000-square-foot house. ([Location 1588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1588))
- The true culprit, the true puppet-master that manipulates our elites from behind the scenes, is the money system itself: a credit-based, interest-driven system that arises from the ancient, rising tide of separation; that generates competition, polarization, and greed; that compels endless exponential growth; and, most importantly, that is coming to an end in our time as the fuel for that growth—social, natural, cultural, and spiritual capital—runs out. ([Location 1611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1611))
- Abetted by technology, the commodification of formerly nonmonetary goods and services has accelerated over the last few centuries, to the point today where very little is left outside the money realm. ([Location 1768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1768))
- This is why there are many paying jobs to be had doing things that are complicit in the conversion of natural and social capital into money, and few jobs to be had reclaiming the commons and protecting natural and cultural treasures. ([Location 1804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=1804))
- No one likes to see rising prices, but if incomes are rising just as fast, what harm is done? The harm is done only to people who have savings; those who have debts actually benefit. What ordinary people fear is price inflation without wage inflation. If both prices and wages rise, then inflation is essentially a tax on idle money, redistributing wealth away from the wealthy and counteracting the effects of interest. ([Location 2007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=2007))
- The time is here, though, for the reverse process to begin in earnest—to remove things from the realm of goods and services and return them to the realm of gifts, reciprocity, self-sufficiency, and community sharing. ([Location 2301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=2301))
- Any forest you save from development, any road you stop, any cooperative playgroup you establish; anyone you teach to heal themselves, or to build their own house, cook their own food, or make their own clothes; any wealth you create or add to the public domain; anything you render off-limits to the world-devouring Machine will help shorten the Machine’s life span. And when the money system collapses, if you already do not depend on money for some portion of life’s necessities and pleasures, then the collapse of money will pose much less of a harsh transition for you. ([Location 2317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=2317))
- But if we are to choose a backed currency, let us be clear about the reasons. It is not to make the money “real” in a way that unbacked currencies are not. It is to imbue money with the story of value that we want to create. ([Location 2694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=2694))
- The money of the future will be backed by the things we want to nurture, create, and preserve: by undeveloped land, clean water and air, great works of art and architecture, biodiversity and the genetic commons, unused development rights, unused carbon credits, uncollected patent royalties, relationships not converted into services, and natural resources not converted into goods. ([Location 2720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=2720))
- On a very practical level, this vision of sacred economy requires eliminating what economists refer to as “externalities.” ([Location 2810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=2810))
- The elimination of externalities thwarts the business plan of the ages: “I keep the income and someone else pays the costs.” ([Location 2826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=2826))
- Understanding this principle, some visionary businesspeople have attempted to realize it voluntarily through concepts like the “triple bottom line” and “full-cost accounting.” The idea is that their company will act to maximize not just its own profits, but the aggregate of people, planet, and profit—the three bottom lines. The problem is that these companies must compete with others who do the opposite: export their costs onto people and the planet. The triple bottom line and full-cost accounting are useful as a way to evaluate public policy (because they include more than just economic benefits) but when it comes to private enterprise, the first two Ps often run counter to the third. ([Location 2845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=2845))
- We must create a system that aligns self-interest with the good of all. ([Location 2852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=2852))
- While both cap-and-trade programs and pollution taxes have a role to play in the internalization of social and ecological costs, we could also integrate them into the structure of money itself, an intentional kind of money that embodies our reverence for the planet and our emerging sense of the role and purpose of humanity on earth. ([Location 2882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=2882))
- kind of work that we use coffee and external motivation (e.g., money) to force ourselves to do is precisely the kind of work that contributes to the despoliation of the planet. We don’t really want to do it to our bodies; we don’t really want to do it to the world. ([Location 2911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=2911))
- Today, access to money, via credit, goes to those who are likely to expand the realm of goods and services. In a sacred economy, it will go to those who contribute to a more beautiful world. While we may not all agree on what that world looks like, many important common values are emerging in our time. I have been gratified to discover, in my interaction with people from all parts of the political spectrum, a near-universal reverence for community, for nature, and for the beautiful products of human culture. ([Location 2966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=2966))
- These decisions often require scientific understanding, but just as often they embody value judgments. Both contribute to our collective agreement on how much natural capital to consume. ([Location 2990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=2990))
- this system embodies the new attitude of environmental responsibility that wants to know and take responsibility for the effects of our actions on other beings. Look what happens to the earth, when we are oblivious to the risk of oil spills and nuclear disasters. Increasingly, we want to know what we are doing, we want to know all the effects of our actions, and we want to take responsibility for them. This attitude is quite natural for the connected self that knows, “As I do unto the other, so I do unto myself.” ([Location 3039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=3039))
- Shouldn’t individuals, then, be able to issue money or obtain credit “backed” by the their own productive resources? ([Location 3096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=3096))
- Irving Fisher, ([Location 3113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=3113))
- Whether in collective life or personal, real change rarely comes in the absence of crisis. ([Location 3299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=3299))
- Today people are already making such decisions even though they are uneconomic, because the truth in our hearts contradicts economic logic. In our hearts we know that the ideology that equates money with the good is wrong. We need to bring money and goodness back into their promised alignment. ([Location 3643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=3643))
- The Austrian School of economics especially, but more generally neoclassical economics as well, extrapolates from such examples to claim that it is human nature to want to consume as much as possible right now. In their view, interest is a kind of compensation for deferring consumption, a reward for delayed gratification. In other words, you, dear reader, would love to maximize your utility by spending all your money right now, but are induced not to because you know that you’ll be able to have even more later, thanks to interest. This is known in economics as the time preference postulate. Time preference—our supposed preference for immediate consumption—is crucial to the discounted utility model developed by Paul Samuelson in the 1930s that lies at the foundation of most mainstream economic theory today. ([Location 3653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=3653))
- Interest, then, is a reward for thrift, for self-restraint. In this view we find an echo of some of the deep, hidden ideologies underlying our civilization; for example, that human progress both spiritual and material comes through winning a war against nature: natural forces on the outside, and desire, pleasure, and the animal drives on the inside. ([Location 3692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=3692))
- As Aristophanes said, in all things—bread, wine, sex, and so on—there is satiety. Our needs are limited, and when we have fulfilled them, we turn to other things and are moved to generosity. “But of money, there is no satiety.” It is not the propensity to consume that bears no limit; to the contrary, limitless desire arises with money. After attaining a surfeit of consumables, people covet money itself, not what it can buy, and this desire has no limit. ([Location 3706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=3706))
- In hunter-gatherer societies, which were generally nomadic, possessions were a literal burden. The “carry cost” that everything except money bears today was quite real. ([Location 3742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=3742))
- In today’s system, it is much better to have a thousand dollars than it is for ten people to owe you a hundred dollars. ([Location 3746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004ZZNNKU&location=3746))
