- Whether you want to learn a new skill or simply be better at the job you were hired to do, it’s now your job to train and invest in yourself. ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050DIWHU&location=136))
- There used to be a long-term pact between employee and employer that guaranteed lifetime employment in exchange for lifelong loyalty; this pact has been replaced by a performance-based, short-term contract that’s perpetually up for renewal by both sides. Professional loyalty now flows “horizontally” to and from your network rather than “vertically” to your boss, as Dan Pink has noted.

- Once-great companies are falling both more frequently and more quickly than in times past. In the 1920s and ’30s firms stayed in the S&P 500 for an average of sixty-five years. By the late 1990s the average tenure was just ten years. John Seely Brown and John Hagel, of Deloitte, report that the topple rate—the rate at which big companies lose their leadership positions—has more than doubled over the past forty years. Today more than ever, “ ‘winners’ have increasingly precarious positions. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050DIWHU&location=270))
- Take intelligent and bold risks to accomplish something great. Build a network of alliances to help you with intelligence, resources, and collective action. Pivot to a breakout opportunity. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050DIWHU&location=289))
- “Most of the time, change in the world overtakes you,” Reed says. When a Hollywood executive once asked him during an on-stage interview whether he makes five-year strategic plans or three-year strategic plans, Reed said he does neither: three years is an eternity in Silicon Valley, and they can’t plan that far in advance. Instead, Netflix stays nimble and iterates, always in the test phase. We call this mind-set “permanent beta.” ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050DIWHU&location=319))
- How are you first, only, faster, better, or cheaper than other people who want to do what you’re doing in the world? What are you offering that’s hard to come by? What are you offering that’s both rare and valuable? ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050DIWHU&location=388))
- You have two types of career assets to keep track of: soft and hard. Soft assets are things you can’t trade directly for money. They’re the intangible contributors to career success: the knowledge and information in your brain; professional connections and the trust you’ve built up with them; skills you’ve mastered; your reputation and personal brand; your strengths (things that come easily to you). ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050DIWHU&location=415))
- That said, and contrary to what many bestselling authors and motivational gurus would have you believe, there is not a “true self” deep within that you can uncover via introspection and that will point you in the right direction.4 Yes, your aspirations shape what you do. But your aspirations are themselves shaped by your actions and experiences. You remake yourself as you grow and as the world changes. Your identity doesn’t get found. It emerges. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050DIWHU&location=463))
- It’s often said that entrepreneurs are dreamers. True. But good entrepreneurs are also firmly grounded in what’s available and possible right now. Specifically, entrepreneurs spend vast amounts of energy trying to figure out what customers will pay for. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050DIWHU&location=481))
- Markets that don’t exist don’t care how smart you are. Similarly, it doesn’t matter how hard you’ve worked or how passionate you are about an aspiration: If someone won’t pay you for your services in the career marketplace, it’s going to be a very hard slog. You aren’t entitled to anything. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050DIWHU&location=496))
- ABZ Planning is the antidote to the “what color is your parachute” approach to career planning. It is an adaptive approach to planning that promotes trial and error. It allows you to aggressively pursue upside and mitigate against possible downside risks. ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050DIWHU&location=693))
- Prioritize Learning Many people defer collecting full-time wages by spending twenty-three consecutive years in school. A high school dropout can make more money in the short run than the guy stuck studying chemistry. But in the long run, the logic goes, a person with a foundation of knowledge and skills will make more money and most likely live a more meaningful life. It’s true. And there’s a similar belief in start-ups: technology companies focus on learning over profitability in the early years to maximize revenue in the later years. Unfortunately, for far too many, focused learning ends at college graduation. They read about stocks and bonds instead of reading books that improve their mind. They compare their cash salary to their peers’ instead of comparing lessons learned. They invest in the stock market and neglect investing in themselves. They focus, in short, on hard assets instead of soft assets. This is a mistake. We’re not suggesting you be a starving, unshaven graduate student forever; you do need to earn money and build economic assets. But as much as you can, prioritize plans that offer the best chance at learning about yourself and the world. Not only will you make more money in the long run, but your career journey will be more fulfilling. Ask yourself, “Which plan will grow my soft assets the fastest?” Even simpler: “Which plan offers the most learning potential?

- Apple hired me into their user experience group, but shortly after starting on the job I learned that product/market fit—the focus of product management—mattered more than user experience or design. You can develop great and important user interfaces, and Apple certainly did, but if customers don’t need or want the product, they won’t buy. At Apple, and in most companies, the product/market fit questions fall under the purview of the product management group, not user experience. And because product management is vital in any product organization, work experience in the area tends to lead to more diverse career opportunities. So, much in the way that the earliest version of PayPal iterated from a digital wallet to an online payment transfer service, I attempted to iterate into a product management role within Apple (Plan “A1”). But the product management jobs required product management experience. It’s a common catch-22: for jobs that require prior experience, how do you get the experience the first time? My solution: do the job for free on the side. I sought out the head of product management within the eWorld group at Apple, James Isaacs, and told him I had a few product ideas. I offered to write them up in addition to everything else I was doing, and I did. Product managers reviewed my ideas and gave me feedback and encouragement. It was a small, reversible bet, an experiment within my job, and it worked well. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050DIWHU&location=797))
- Relationship builders prioritize high-quality relationships over a large number of connections. Networkers focus on tactical ways to meet new people. They think about how to dominate a cocktail party or how to cold-call an important person in their field. Relationship builders start by understanding how their existing relationships constitute a social network, and they meet new people through people they already know.
