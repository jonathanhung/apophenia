- I wasn’t socially isolated. I was surrounded by smart, funny, interesting people who I was constantly meeting at every brunch, meetup, and dinner party I went to. On weekends there were dozens of exciting events and activities to attend. I had a great time at potlucks, meetups, and events but I rarely got to see the people I met there anywhere els (Page 14)

- advance any time you want to see a friend! (Page 14)
- I organized a professional community group for other Black people who practice design (my line of work) and I created an event called Better than Small Talk for people who value good conversatio (Page 15)
- they only provided me with a few reliable friends that I got to see away from the meetup (Page 15)
- Turning lovely acquaintances into close friends (Page 15)
- Making friends as an adult, I’d discovered, is work. It’s not like being a kid on the playground where having the same color sneakers or a fondness for swings is enough to call someone a frien (Page 16)
- As we age, research shows that we get more isolated from the people around us.2 (Page 17)
- While starting over in a new city is exciting, it frequently means struggling to satisfy the basic human need for belonging and connectio (Page 18)
- takes constant effort, and results aren’t guaran teed. Cultivating friendship is like nurturing a garden (Page 18)
- We Should Get Together is your guide to becoming a green thumb at cultivating friendships that last. (Page 18)

- take a room full of people and instruct them to move around the room—sometimes in creative ways like pretending to walk through waist-deep molasses or imagining that they’re tiptoeing through the house to sneak out at midnight (Page 22)
- For example: The Ungame was invented in 1972, Conversation Cafe has been worldwide for over a decade, Free Intelligent Conversa tion is held in public spaces nationwide, Big Talk cards are available all over the world, Chatty Cafe is held in the U.K., End Small Talk (which I did one cross-continent collaboration event with) is held in Dubai, Tea with Strangers is held nationwide (Page 24)
- What does the word “friend” even mean to us anymore? Social media has made it synonymous with everything from the acquaintances you used to work with at your part-time job ten years ago to the lifelong BFFs who would give you their kidney. On social media, a “friend” might be the cutie you met at the Halloween party, the spybots masquerading as friends of your friends, or the coworkers you sit in meetings with but probably don’t invite to hang out at your house after work (Page 32)
- A 2018 study by Cigna on loneliness found that: • 46 percent of Americans report feeling lonely some or all of the time • One in four Americans feel like there’s no one they can talk to, or like there’s no one who understands them • One in five Americans report that they rarely or never feel close to people3 (Page 33)
- art classes, gardening clubs, and cooking classes. (Page 35)
- impersonal, ...anonymity, ...superficiality,… highly fractionalized, … social disorganization in technological society,… The bonds of kinship, of neighborliness, are likely to be absent, … And last but not least: Frequent close physical contact coupled with great social distance accentuates the reserve of unattached individuals toward one another and, unless compensated for by other opportunities for response, give rise to loneliness.1 (Page 36)
- When you think about your own friendship landscape, what does it look like? How many durable friendships do you have? (Page 37)
- HOW FRIENDSHIP GOT SO COMPLICATED 27 Where are your closest friends located? Who can you have real conversations with or turn to in a crisis? If you want a new best friend, do you know how to make one? If your life is filled with interesting acquaintances, do you know how to convert them into close friends? What do you do when you discover that you’re surrounded by people who don’t really know who you are? (Page 38)
- What is up with us? (Page 43)
- exploring the ones that I’ve found to be most common: hypermobility, busyness, relationships/family, and the shrinking capacity for intimacy in the digital era. (Page 44)
- Dr. Jeffrey Hall, a professor at the University of Kansas, found that it takes ninety to 200 hours to turn a stranger or acquaintance into a close friend. (Page 48)
- key factor in the students’ success forming new friends was having a large quantity of inter actions. (Page 48)
- because they don’t have a lot of free time, they’re lonely right now, and they’re getting their friend-time in two-hour blocks, often weeks or months apar (Page 49)
- robust immersion in quality connection marked by vulner ability, self-disclosure, and empathetic listening, experienced in a concentrated form, can fast-track a friendship into existence in a shorter amount of time (Page 49)
- call this hydroponic friendship. In the absence of abundant soil (aka abundant time), nutrients (aka deeply-enriching, immersive experiences of connection) can be supplied to the plant (aka people) in such a way that growth (aka friendship) can fully blossom and thrive. (Page 49)
- These connections require dedicated attention and a willingness to apply ourselves. Just like it’s possible to develop a romantic relationship when partners agree to make it a priority, we can also nurture nascent and anemic friendships to become more satisfying and successfu (Page 50)
- connect with each other in life-enriching, life-expanding ways that fill our days with meaning and make this life worth living. (Page 50)

- found that if a person moves away from a place where they have daily face-to-face interactions with friends and family, they will have to earn an extra $133,000 to make up for the unhappiness and social disconnection that their relocation causes. (Page 55)

- long-termers are not open to newcomers, preferring to spend their time and energy with other long-termers who they know will be sticking aroun (Page 55)
- If a newcomer is going to skip town in six months and leave the long-termers behind with no one to hang out with, the long-termers may think that building a friendship with them is a waste of time and effort (Page 55)
- I could reach eight different friends by walking less than ten minutes from my front doo (Page 56)
- I felt “at home” just passing by their houses and knowing that they were inside. I firmly believe that home isn’t an address—it’s wherever you feel like you belong (Page 56)

- But if your friendships are going to be real, then your connection to them should continue to exist even if they move across town, or across the planet. Enduring friendship goes beyond zip codes. (Page 56)
- The depth of a longstanding friend ship can make it possible to withstand long bouts of geographical distance, especially if we keep in touch frequently in other ways (Page 56)
- Organize a Neighborhood Social Pick a local coffee shop that has room for several people to sit together comfortably and chat at a conversational volume. Drop off invitations at your neighbors’ doors inviting them to a neighbor hood social at that location for two hours on a Saturday afternoon. You don’t even have to write your name on the invitations if you want it to feel mysterious and a little magical, but signing the invite is a good way to build community. It lets people know that you’re open to being reached out to as well. You might find yourself on the receiving end of other invitations to dinners, game nights, movie nights, and extra baked goods. Who wouldn’t like a little more of that? For inspiration, check out teawithstrangers.com, which has tips for putting together successful gatherings like this. (Page 59)
- There didn’t need to be a sensible story about how she came to know each person—we were just, as she put it, “random awesome people.” Look around your life at your closest and most-frequently travelled paths. Are random awesome people right there waiting for a chance to meet you? (Page 60)
- it takes several weeks and several dozen text messages to get a slot in someone’s calendar, your momentum could evaporate (Page 61)
- had brunch in March and don’t hang out again until Labor Day, it might be too late for a real friendship to take root. (Page 61)

- Frequency is often subject to the hands of fate and gets squashed by other factors like distance and bloated calendars. Or sometimes it just comes down to having different preference (Page 63)
- If your frequency hopes are out of sync, you’ve got some decisions to make. Have a conversation about what you’re each feeling and willing to offer. (Page 64)
