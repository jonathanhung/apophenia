- *dissolution* as a sort of evolution in reverse that happens when higher brain structures no longer inhibit lower structures (Franz & Gillett, 2011; York III & Steinberg, 2011). You see this when your client’s prefrontal cortex shuts down in response to a situation that feels overwhelming, leaving their limbic system to mount a response. The autonomic nervous system can likewise be seen through the lens of hierarchy and dissolution. Looking at the evolution of the autonomic nervous system, there is an emergence of a three-part system that is distinct and measurable, creating a predictable hierarchy of response (Porges & Carter, 2017). The autonomic nervous system also follows a predictable pathway of dissolution, moving from ventral vagal safety and connection down the hierarchy into the sympathetic mobilization of fight and flight and finally to the earliest state of dorsal vagal shutdown ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grxs6zfcv9vyrv9bsd8ty4fg))
- High and low variability is associated with changes in the ability for the brain (prefrontal region) to promote cognitive and emotional self-regulation (Park & Thayer, 2014). Another rhythm, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, tracks the changes in heart rate associated with breath patterns (Sahar, Shalev, & Porges, 2001). This beat-and-breath rhythm shifts in response to both physical and psychological needs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grxsdpamsj19amgzghk89mmm))
- The autonomic nervous system responds moment to moment to what are often competing needs to survive and to be social. In a state of protection, survival is the only goal. The system is closed to connection and change. In a state of connection, health, growth, and restoration are possible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grxsjy825q8hbmzxm8qk673d))
- Clients are faced with the dilemma of balancing the drive to survive with the longing to connect. The responses that were necessary and adaptive for survival in the past bring suffering in the present. Trauma stories are held in autonomic pathways that are tuned to a low threshold–high intensity pattern of responding. A question to ask when your client feels the rise of an adaptive survival response is, “Does this autonomic shift feel familiar?” The activation in the present moment often leads them back to the autonomic origin in their past ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grxshwdx9m8x3gsy1pbh0m02))
- When family dynamics are based in experiences of autonomic misattunement, there is little chance for experiences of repair. When the adults in a family carry their own patterns of dysregulation, habitually triggered into states of protection and unable to return to regulation and offer the safety of connection, the child’s autonomic nervous system responds by creating its own patterns of protection ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grxsq6qft87q6gpsq27k1e13))
- Trauma survivors often suffer from unpredictable, rapid, intense, and prolonged states of dysregulation. This autonomic imbalance and lack of flexibility leads to health problems. Physical problems include impaired immune function, digestive problems, respiratory problems, diabetes, increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and chronic fatigue ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grxsty8xcddjz7f4dtr1va30))
- three autonomic states ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs19bhr02v739gyk3sggwfff))
- The earliest dorsal vagal system runs in the background, regulating organs below the diaphragm, including the digestive system. The sympathetic nervous system, next to arrive, works to circulate blood, shape normal heart rhythms, regulate body temperature, respond to changes in posture, and provide energy to the system to support passion and play. The most recent system, the ventral vagal system, brings the ability for connection and social engagement. The ventral vagus is tasked with overseeing the autonomic nervous system, metaphorically holding the sympathetic and dorsal vagal systems in a warm embrace. When the newest autonomic pathway is directing the system, healthy homeostasis is the result. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs19e4gcmtm27fte8t31apt5))
- Beginning in the brainstem, the dorsal vagus primarily influences organs below the diaphragm and the ventral vagus mainly affects organs above the diaphragm. Through the dorsal and ventral vagal pathways, messages are sent in two directions. Sensory information travels from the body to the brain and motor information returns from the brain to the body, making this a rich, bidirectional information highway. The two vagal pathways represent either end of the evolutionary history of the autonomic nervous system. The oldest dorsal vagal (our reptilian ancestors) and the newest ventral vagal (uniquely mammalian) are at opposite ends of the continuum of response from dorsal vagal immobilization and disconnection to ventral vagal social engagement ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gye3trzpq6yqpdsgzq47j4et))
- Activity of the ventral vagus, often referred to as vagal tone, can be measured through heart rate variability. While heart rate measures the number of beats per minute, heart rate variability measures the variation in time between heartbeats. A high level of variability indicates the ventral vagus is active and results in a flexible autonomic nervous system and the ability to adjust to the demands of daily living ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs19j0422x5f9s35x45mxhrc))
- Where sympathetic and dorsal vagal states activate an either/or experience constricting the ability to see beyond limited options, the ventral vagal state at the top of the hierarchy brings alive the expansive world of both/and that is filled with possibilities and choices. The ventral vagal experience is one of being a part of the world, connected to self, able to reach out to others, open to change and willing to look at possibilities. Here, solitude and social connection, excitement and rest, joy and sadness, and frustration and flow are found. The glue for the diverse ventral vagal experiences is a sense of safety. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy01gmhjvqg2kxvnas5ba3je))
- the autonomic nervous system evolved and the ventral vagus emerged at the top of the hierarchy, the roots of five cranial nerves (trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, accessory, and vagal) came together in the brainstem to create an integrated social engagement system. The ventral vagal pathway from the heart connected with pathways that control muscles of the face and head, regulating how you see, hear, speak, express emotions with your face, and turn and tilt your head, forming a “face-heart” connection ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy01mtg5rp7ym6hkfaer4j5v))
- Events are sometimes beyond the capacity of the ventral vagus to regulate the system. Illness and traumatic events predictably tax the system, but everyday experiences can also trigger dysregulation. Feeling alone, having too many responsibilities in a day, working in a challenging environment, and being in a distressed relationship are just some of the experiences that can overwhelm the ventral vagal system.
  MINI EXERCISE
  – What are some of the ordinary difficulties that predictably overwhelm your system?
  – Is there an extraordinary distress that is too great a challenge for your system? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs19twvax5c85qg0msc9kggm))
- when your ventral vagal capacity is depleted, you move one step down the hierarchy and enter the energy of the sympathetic nervous system and the experiences of fight and flight. This survival response is fueled by adrenaline and cortisol. Here you are a system in motion, or more accurately a system in commotion. Flooded with mobilizing energy, you no longer look for connection; you are now focused simply on survival ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy01rajtp1pkfhvyz7xkaav9))
- These early autonomic patterns live on through neuroceptive tendencies that create an autonomic profile ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyegdn3tbs5va3a54nzad1ym))
- A neuroception of safety is incompatible with a neuroception of danger or life-threat, making this an either/or experience (Porges, 2015a). Through neuroception, your autonomic nervous system is either open to connection and the possibility of change or locked in a protective response and stuck in a survival story. Patterns of connection arise from cues of safety that the down-regulate your defense systems and activate the social engagement system (Porges 2015a ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyegebd8v0fcp71qc91shb4r))
- What are the cues of safety and danger? Are there enough cues of safety to bring you into a readiness for connection? Or do the cues of danger keep you poised for protection?
  Use this question to look through the lens of discernment: In this moment, with this person, in this place, surrounded by these things, are you actually in danger, or are you safe? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyeggm0aknk1bxs350cv63yw))
- Cues of life-threat bring a shift into a dorsal vagal state of immobilization or collapse. With cues of danger you step into sympathetic fight and flight. Cues of safety activate the ventral vagal branch and the social engagement system. A pang of hunger, the size and temperature of a room, the feel of a chair, a face with a smile or a frown are just some of the experiences that are taken in by the process of neuroception and bring an autonomic response. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grm5aaw6eey1vz14gvm5w89a))
- What was the cue of safety or danger that you followed downstream into feeling, behavior, and finally story? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyegms0j92w2576c01dq4d2f))
- Beginning with the way we are welcomed into the world the autonomic nervous system starts to build a story about relationships. How much of that story is about connection and how much is about protection depends on whether we have regulated and regulating people surrounding ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyegq04dmbb5a04hrg3rfp3m))
- Yet, even as we develop self-regulating capacities, the need for social interaction and co-regulation remains throughout our lifetime (Porges & Furman, 2011). We depend on the people around us for co-regulation and try to offer experiences of co-regulation in return. Sometimes, however, rather than a co-regulating experience we find we are engaged in mutual dysregulation. We follow a friend into anxiety, lose hope along with our partner, or find ourselves in a state of opposition to others ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyegqve222bgt9h6mse92x64))
- When there is ongoing misattunement, when ruptures aren’t recognized and repaired, the autonomic experience of persistent danger shapes the system away from connection into patterns of protection. Loneliness is a subjective experience. It emerges not from the objective facts of social isolation but out of a perception of social isolation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyegt2t10weh6y2rrvev9w0m))
- When we move into hypervigilance for threat, it’s difficult to send signals of welcome to others. Through the cues of safety and danger we send out into the world people feel our *social temperature*—warm and welcoming, hot and bothered, or cold and calculating (Ijzerman et al., 2012). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyegsc2wd395r2f6w286p050))
- Social connection is the subjective experience of being connected to others (Seppälä, Rossomando, & Doty, 2013). Social support on the other hand may be an exchange relationship in which services, information, and advice are offered. While social support has a necessary place in your life, if you don’t also experience social connection, you can feel a deep sense of loneliness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyeh1n5d1g5j5xg22g63n9kn))
- When offers of social support and acts of social interaction include the sense of companionship, then co-regulation and social connection ease the sense of loneliness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyeh2330573vxxbr8d9pyy96))
- If a core component of well-being is the predictable opportunity for co-regulating relationships, then trauma might be described as the chronic disruption of connectedness (Porges, 2014). Trauma creates ongoing adaptive survival responses that keep the autonomic nervous system from finding safety in connection. Without experiences of co-regulation, and without trust that ongoing opportunities for co-regulation are available, the autonomic pathways that support moving out of protection into connection aren’t exercised and strengthened ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55e2r2a6cnjgs9jadwp4ayp))
- The BASIC framework—Befriend, Attend, Shape, Integrate, Connect—helps your clients develop skills in autonomic regulation leading to increased flexibility of response and resilience. Repatterning the nervous system depends on bringing explicit awareness to implicit experiences, interrupting automatic response patterns, and engaging the ventral vagal safety circuit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55e5jahs8gecfrrmrghav19))
- **Shape.** Trauma interrupts the ability to regulate autonomic state and flexibly transition between states. Just as the brain has the capacity to rewire, the autonomic nervous system can also establish new patterns. Shaping the system away from habitual survival responses into patterns of connection involves bringing mindful attention to practices that increase the capacity for staying anchored in the ventral vagal system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55f4a8hvmd48d81psnf618q))
- When the autonomic nervous system has been shaped by trauma, there is often a disconnection between physiological state, psychological story, and behavioral response. Cues of danger seem to be everywhere and the smallest reminder of a traumatic experience activates a survival response ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h55f4qz25eew3wqbxnc167e4))
- Befriending establishes the ability to safely feel autonomic states, identify individual aspects of each state, and activate and maintain curiosity and compassion during the process. Many of your clients live in their stories, disconnected from the body states from which those stories emerge. And as van der Kolk (2014) reminds us, “You can be fully in charge of your life only if you can acknowledge the reality of your body, in all its visceral dimensions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h57sgxjs5rz015vsdtz6355d))
- Sensing, naming, and identifying what is going on inside is the first step to recovery” (van der Kolk, 2014, [p. 68](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32256679#page_68)). Recognizing sympathetic mobilization and dorsal vagal immobilization as adaptive survival responses triggered by too many cues of danger and not enough cues of safety helps your clients reappraise their responses as actions in service of survival ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h57shtyz6d5r5nq4nnkw246a))
