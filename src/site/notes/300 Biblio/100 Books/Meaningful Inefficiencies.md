- topic::  



## Insights
---
The text is about the work of civic designers who are reshaping public-serving organizations by creating relationships and building trust with the public. The designers are using strategies such as network building, holding space for discussion, distributing ownership, and persistent input to create meaningful inefficiencies, which focus on care and play rather than solely on efficiency. The book also highlights the challenges faced by individual practitioners and encourages a rethinking of how innovation within public-serving organizations is understood. Overall, the focus is on mobilizing publics by creating opportunities to play within systems, leading to caring relationships among the public and organizations.

- The school times were calculated by a team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who developed a system to change school schedules in coordination with new bus routes that were put in place the year before. It was a feat of systems engineering that allowed them to meet specific requirements about start and end times while coordinating with the fleet of busses crossing Boston’s congested narrow streets. The only thing they didn’t appropriately consider was the impact these positive changes for high school students would have on the city’s primary school students and families. As angry parents held signs such as “Students Are Not Widgets” and “Families Over Algorithms,” the message to the school committee was unmistakable. Big data has its limits, and sometimes the most important data comes from talking to people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6p2pqfvjz3340n0tse1qyns))
- People tend to like efficient systems if the goals are clear, universal, and transactional—for example, a new city website to make it easier to pay parking tickets or a new distribution of salt trucks before a snowstorm to cover more streets faster. These efficiencies would likely be welcomed without need for extensive consultation. But when decisions about systems impact the structure and flow of people’s everyday lives, the justification for boundaries and rules matters, and friction becomes a feature—not a bug.

- When parents resisted the school committee’s decision, seemingly dictated by machines, they were not resisting the outcomes *per se,* but the mechanics of decision making. The optics of machine intelligence determining what is best for children and families were anathema to commonly held assumptions or aspirations of democratic processes. In this case, the invisibility of computing was shrouding the desired visibility of democracy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6p2trvaj06v2r5249r027ga))
- What’s at stake in this contemporary transformation is the ability of organizations to mediate trusting relationships with publics. A recent study from the Pew Research Center has shown that trust in the US federal government is at an all-time low ([Pew Research Center, 2017](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/75792138#oso-9780190870140-bibliography-1-bibItem-91)).

- It is about those people working within public-serving organizations that are attempting to reshape programs, mission, and purpose by creating the conditions through which organizations form relationships and build trust with publics. Without coordinating, these designers have adopted a common framework we call “meaningful inefficiencies,” or the deliberate design of less efficient over more efficient means of achieving some ends. These practitioners are already employed by organizations all over the world; but in most cases, the organizations don’t know it yet. They masquerade as technologists, communication specialists, journalists, producers, and engagement officers, but they’re doing the work of designers, and they are thoughtfully, and often quietly, innovating the shape of civic life.

- So what makes a process *meaningfully* inefficient? It’s when the inefficiency scaffolds interactions that serve to connect people to one another. Consider the example of a remote-controlled car. For many children, it is not an uncommon experience to spend hours putting together a car, only to play with it for 30 minutes before putting it in the closet for the remainder of its existence. Building a model remote-controlled car can be an enjoyable process for children and adults, but one typically rushes through building it to arrive quickly at the goal. As a counterpoint to this phenomenon, the Nitro Racer is a model remote-controlled car that comes as part of a magazine subscription, where each month exactly one part is delivered with the issue. After 3 years, the final part arrives and the car can be completed. This would be a mere inefficiency if the goal was simply to play with the car. But if the goal, as it was explained to us by a colleague, was to have an extended project to do with his son, then in fact the inefficiency was meaningful. The self-imposed obstacle of the 3-year timeline transforms the goal of the project from the completion of the car to the time spent with someone while completing the car (see [Figure I.2](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/75792138#oso-9780190870140-chapter-1-figureGroup-2)). The Nitro Racer is not an innovation in model cars; it is an innovation of the system one engages in to build a model car. This is an important distinction, because innovative design does not always mean innovative objects; it can mean innovative logics through which objects are produced.

- The decision a player makes to step outside of everyday life and to step into a play space, or magic circle ([Huizinga, 1955](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/75792138#oso-9780190870140-bibliography-1-bibItem-55)), is almost always an inefficiency inserted into some larger system of exchange and interaction. The philosopher Bernard Suits describes the experience of playing a game as follows: “To play a game is to attempt to achieve a specific state of affairs [prelusory goal], using only means permitted by rules [lusory means], where the rules prohibit use of more efficient in favour of less efficient means [constitutive rules], and where the rules are accepted just because they make possible such activity [lusory attitude]” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6p37yj99epm5e8jvq9cgavb))
- This book is inspired by games as they are a productive analog to the kinds of play spaces created by civic designers. And while we will be using actual games as examples throughout the book, games are by no means a privileged or ideal form ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6p39t37ddd6q5y7j33sz56c))
- To design meaningful inefficiencies is to design spaces for play within a larger system, such that the consequences of play augment the player’s perception and use of the system. For example, participatory budgeting can be a meaningful inefficiency, insofar as it presents a goal and inserts lengthy deliberation as an obstacle to achieving that goal ([Lerner, 2015](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/75792138#oso-9780190870140-bibliography-1-bibItem-69)). The result is not merely to slow down the budgeting process, but to open up a piece of the process to public deliberation so as to both instruct the public in how budgeting works and to empower them in shaping outcomes. The outcome of meaningful inefficiencies in these examples is to hold space for people, for social interaction, and for moments of productive encounter in which infinite possibilities exist. Without these encounters, organizations dictate a world prescribed by systems, predicted by their makers with little room for variability.

- This book is based on years of practice designing with public-serving organizations and over 60 interviews, and self-administered reflections, conducted by and with practitioners invested in building strong publics through media and technology. All interviews and reflections were conducted between 2013 and 2018. All interviews were conducted under the supervision of an Institutional Review Board (IRB), but they were collected as part of four distinct research projects ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6p3x5qq13cm6syvbnhv9kdy))
- As a result, this book places a practical emphasis on organizational and institutional transformation. We are inspired by the work of philosopher Hugh Heclo. In his book *On Thinking Institutionally* (2008), he argues that institutions are not legal structures; they are norms that guide how groups of individuals act collectively. He suggests that institutions frame most social interactions whether or not people are aware of them. He goes on to criticize what he deems the “postmodern stance,” which rejects all inherited values as cultural oppressions and believes that “meaning is to be found only in self-creation, not faithful reception of something beyond oneself” (pp. 100–101). Heclo argues this position mistakes the organization for the institutional values that underlie it. Every individual or individual organization brings the moral framework of institutions to bear on their actions. A nonprofit, local news organization is operating in the institutional framework of journalism, even if they resist the dominant values that comprise it.

- The work of facilitating democratic process through trust building is more than just an individual action, or even the action of a single organization. It requires forefronting institutional values, even if they are not clearly stated and universally accepted. This expression of values is often in conflict with the efficiency needs of an organization. For example, a grassroots news organization in Chicago invests time in facilitating community conversations around controversial police data, as opposed to a singular focus on publishing more stories ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6p493weckw03k8pd6b96qav))
- Civic design, as we define it, requires a challenging of the presumptions of efficiency; namely, a challenge to the presumption that the primary purpose of designed systems is to achieve a stated goal with the least expenditure of resources. The insertion of slack, or room to play, within a system is a necessary action to achieve this (a concept that we will explore in great detail in [Chapter 3](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/75792138#oso-9780190870140-chapter-4)).

- Meaningful inefficiencies reinforce what the philosopher Hannah Arendt would call the human condition. The human condition, she says, exists within a tripartite formulation known as the *vita activa*, which includes labor, work, and action. The *vita activa*, the active life, distinct from the *vita contemplativa*, or the thinking life, is what distinguishes humans from animals ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6p4kpfqrarsv2gah41zjwa3))
- the *vita activa* suggests that humans are active, purpose and meaning driven, and defined by labor, not just thoughts. Labor, that which is ongoing and meets biological needs for subsistence, is put into relation with work, or that which has specific outcomes and meaning. And each is in relation to action, which is the means by which humans disclose themselves to each other. Action can be a conversation with friends, a post on social media, or simply co-presence. What’s important about Arendt’s understanding of action is that it is always open ended—it invites new beginnings—and is connected to labor and work. Our use of the word *action* throughout this book stems from this Arendtian concept. So action is not just a thing one does, but an activity that purposely seeks to unleash new beginnings.

- So far, we have described the structure of civic design, but what of the actual content? Through our interviews with practitioners and reflections on our own practice, we have identified four primary activities that comprise a meaningfully inefficient process: network building, holding space for discussion, distributing ownership, and persistent input ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6p4j1s6srj2nym7wky8ayhv))
- *Make the Breast Pump Not Suck*, it brought together hundreds of people who have never participated in, and in many cases, never heard of a hackathon before. Leading up to the event, the year-long planning process sought to distribute ownership beyond the typical stakeholders of innovation and to those rarely consulted, specifically poor women of color. As it was held at the MIT Media Lab, which represents a kind of exclusive access to invention, the organizers spent months building mutual trust so that newcomers would feel comfortable navigating the hackathon. [D’Ignazio et al. (2016)](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/75792138#oso-9780190870140-bibliography-1-bibItem-28) suggest that their approach “favors learning over invention, prioritizes listening over ideating, values the production of new social relations over the production of objects.” The hackathon was designed with *care*. The organizers were keenly aware of the effort required to care with others in design and to build reciprocal relationships such that participants in systems are not objects, but subjects of their own making ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6q0pqbsj0vws5rgabr6hp5h))
- This has led us to a logical conclusion that is animating this book: It is the primary responsibility of public-serving organizations to create and support the conditions through which people care for the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6q0wb8xmt16kvv9nejkgfp5))
- One can care about climate change without feeling responsibility to act. According to philosopher Nel [Noddings, *caring about*](#oso-9780190870140-bibliography-1-bibItem-84) is a state of readiness. “We can . . . ‘care about’ everyone; that is, we can maintain an internal state of readiness to try to care for whoever crosses our path” (p. 17). But the actual condition of *caring for* is quite a different thing, she says. It suggests reciprocity, where the one caring and the cared for are mutually engaged in a relationship that leaves each open to discovery. It involves a “stepping out of one’s personal frame of reference into an other’s” (p. 22). Put another way, Nodding states that when caring for another, “We are in the world of relation, having stepped out of the instrumental world; we have either not yet established goals or we have suspended striving for those already established. We are not attempting to transform the world, but we are allowing ourselves to be transformed” (p. 33) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6q3fmhsajwq3x74c26mn5cw))
- Just because one knows or even cares about an issue does not mean she has the capacity to act. This takes *caring for*, where one’s actions emerge in relation to others and are motivated by mutual responsibility between the actor and the acted upon.

- Actions, as defined by Hannah Arendt and as we have explained in previous chapters, are new beginnings, and beginnings always end. The problem then becomes how an organization supports the conditions for action taking ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6q598hj3w79x7yz617yfyts))
- In the last chapter, we introduced play as the precondition for action taking. In this chapter, we explain how organizations support action taking itself. This happens through the manufacture of what Eric [Klinenberg (2018)](#oso-9780190870140-bibliography-1-bibItem-61) calls “social infrastructure,” or the physical and institutional manifestations for social cohesion. Social infrastructure, we argue, is where caring about can transform into caring with. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6q5a9q735tk8ajqscykm3vd))
