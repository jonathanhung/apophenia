- So the question is more about this: are you only achieving average results in relation to where you or your business or team is supposed to be? ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049B1VO0&location=333))
- The question is, What defines reality? When pruning a rosebush, the first step is to ask, “What does a rose look like?” In other words, you have to know the standard you are pruning toward. The gardener knows what a healthy bud, branch, or bloom looks like and prunes with that standard in mind. The same thing is true in business and life—we have to have a good definition of what we want the outcome to look like and prune toward that.

- So step one for yourself or your business is naming the “rose”—in other words, defining the standard or goal you’re pruning toward. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049B1VO0&location=422))
- For GE, being first or second is that concept in action. It is in complete alignment with the reality that both businesses and individuals will begin, gather, and have more activities than they can reasonably sustain. Some of those activities may be good, but they are taking up resources that your best ones need. So you always will have to choose between good and best. This is especially tough for some creative people, causing them a lack of focus. They create more than they can focus on and feed, they are attached to every idea as if they were all equal, and they try to keep them all alive. Instead of a to-do list, they have a to-do pile.

- In your business and in your life, don’t just “cut back” and think that you have pruned. Pruning is strategic. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049B1VO0&location=516))
- “We only have a little time, let’s stay away from certain issues and focus on what we can do something about,” ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049B1VO0&location=536))
- “Let’s use our time in a good way,” the resources of time and energy would be better spent. ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049B1VO0&location=537))
- According to brain research and theory, we seem to have a capacity to really manage about 140 to 150 relationships. Obviously not all to the same degree, but the system can handle that number, apparently. ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049B1VO0&location=779))

- Also, they want a world where they have no limits. They want to believe that they have enough time and energy to gather people, products, and activities infinitely and never have to end any of them. They do not want it to be true that at some point, they run out of time and energy and have to make hard choices. They want a limitless life where time and space are not realities.

- Pain by its nature is a signal that something is wrong, and action is required. So pain should be driving you to do something to end it. But if you are not making moves to end the dull misery of something going nowhere, then you may have told yourself nothing is really “wrong”—it is just the way it is.

- In a learned-helplessness model, the brain begins to interpret events in a negative way, thus reinforcing its belief that “all is bad.” For instance, when someone doesn’t get a sale, it means “I am a loser, the whole business is bad, and it isn’t going to change.” These are called by Seligman and others the three P’s. Events are processed in predictable, negative ways: first, as personalized (I am a bad salesperson); second, as pervasive (everything I do, or every aspect of the business, is bad); and third, as permanent (nothing is going to change).

- “I am not doing this ‘to you.’ I am doing it ‘for me.’ ” ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049B1VO0&location=1055))
- people have a mind-set, or “delusional attitudes” that keep the old, inaccurate reality in place. As long as these attitudes are operative, it is difficult for the new, accurate reality to do its fueling work, to provide both the urgency and the motivation needed to execute a change. How to fully grasp reality and get rid of these mind-sets and attitudes is the subject of this chapter. ([Location 1177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049B1VO0&location=1177))
- In short, she lost hope in the old way, even when it was succeeding. To understand that, you have to go back to the point where she learned to recognize life cycles and seasons and learned to see that if she didn’t recognize them, ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0049B1VO0&location=1215))
