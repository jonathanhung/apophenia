## Highlights

- How much we know and understand ourselves is critically important, but there is something that is even more essential to living a Wholehearted life: loving ourselves. ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=88))
- Deliberate in their thoughts and behaviors through prayer, meditation, or simply setting their intentions; Inspired to make new and different choices; Going. They take action. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=197))
- Trying to co-opt or win over someone like that guy is always a mistake, because it means trading in your authenticity for approval. You stop believing in your worthiness and start hustling for it. And, oh man, was I hustling. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=269))
- If we share our shame story with the wrong person, they can easily become one more piece of flying debris in an already dangerous storm. We want solid connection in a situation like this—something akin to a sturdy tree firmly planted in the ground. We definitely want to avoid the following: The friend who hears the story and actually feels shame for you. She gasps and confirms how horrified you should be. Then there is awkward silence. Then you have to make her feel better. The friend who responds with sympathy (I feel so sorry for you) rather than empathy (I get it, I feel with you, and I’ve been there). If you want to see a shame cyclone turn deadly, throw one of these at it: “Oh, you poor thing.” Or, the incredibly passive-aggressive southern version of sympathy: “Bless your heart.” The friend who needs you to be the pillar of worthiness and authenticity. She can’t help because she’s too disappointed in your imperfections. You’ve let her down. The friend who is so uncomfortable with vulnerability that she scolds you: “How did you let this happen? What were you thinking?” Or she looks for someone to blame: “Who was that guy? We’ll kick his ass.” The friend who is all about making it better and, out of her own discomfort, refuses to acknowledge that you can actually be crazy and make terrible choices: “You’re exaggerating. It wasn’t that bad. You rock. You’re perfect. Everyone loves you.” The friend who confuses “connection” with the opportunity to one-up you: “That’s nothing. Listen to what happened to me one time!” ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=285))
- we’ve lost touch with the idea that speaking honestly and openly about who we are, about what we’re feeling, and about our experiences (good and bad) is the definition of courage. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=329))
- This research has taught me that if we really want to practice compassion, we have to start by setting boundaries and holding people accountable for their behavior. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=400))
- Sometimes we only think we’re connected. Technology, for instance, has become a kind of imposter for connection, making us believe we’re connected when we’re really not—at least not in the ways we need to be. In our technology-crazed world, we’ve confused being communicative with feeling connected. Just because we’re plugged in, doesn’t mean we feel seen and heard. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=452))
- One of the greatest barriers to connection is the cultural importance we place on “going it alone.” Somehow we’ve come to equate success with not needing anyone. Many of us are willing to extend a helping hand, but we’re very reluctant to reach out for help when we need it ourselves. It’s as if we’ve divided the world into “those who offer help” and “those who need help.” The truth is that we are both. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=458))
- Until we can receive with an open heart, we are never really giving with an open heart. When we attach judgment to receiving help, we knowingly or unknowingly attach judgment to giving help. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=463))
- only one thing separated the men and women who felt a deep sense of love and belonging from the people who seem to be struggling for it. That one thing is the belief in their worthiness. It’s as simple and complicated as this: If we want to fully experience love and belonging, we must believe that we are worthy of love and belonging. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=480))
- we stand outside of our story and hustle for our worthiness by constantly performing, perfecting, pleasing, and proving. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=484))
- Most of us use the terms fitting in and belonging interchangeably, and like many of you, I’m really good at fitting in. We know exactly how to hustle for approval and acceptance. We know what to wear, what to talk about, how to make people happy, what not to mention—we know how to chameleon our way through the day. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=505))
- One of the biggest surprises in this research was learning that fitting in and belonging are not the same thing, and, in fact, fitting in gets in the way of belonging. Fitting in is about assessing a situation and becoming who you need to be to be accepted. Belonging, on the other hand, doesn’t require us to change who we are; it requires us to be who we are. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=507))
- Belonging is the innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. Because this yearning is so primal, we often try to acquire it by fitting in and by seeking approval, which are not only hollow substitutes for belonging, but often barriers to it. Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=530))
- Practicing self-love means learning how to trust ourselves, to treat ourselves with respect, and to be kind and affectionate toward ourselves. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=538))
- When I’m having one of those days that I just described, some of the anxiety is just a part of living, but there are days when most of my anxiety grows out of the expectations I put on myself. I want Ellen’s project to be amazing. I want to take care of Charlie without worrying about my own deadlines. I want to show the world how great I am at balancing my family and career. I want our yard to look beautiful. I want people to see us picking up our dog’s poop in biodegradable bags and think, My God! They are such outstanding citizens. There are days when I can fight the urge to be everything to everyone, and there are days when it gets the best of me. ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=695))
- As we discussed in the last chapter, when we struggle to believe in our worthiness, we hustle for it. The hustle for worthiness has its own soundtrack and for those of you who are my age and older, it’s not the funky “Do the Hustle” from the ’70s. It’s the cacophony of shame tapes and gremlins—those messages that fuel “never good enough.” “What will people think?” “You can’t really love yourself yet. You’re not ________________ enough.” (pretty, skinny, successful, rich, talented, happy, smart, feminine, masculine, productive, nice, strong, tough, caring, popular, creative, well-liked, admired, contributing) “No one can find out about _____________.” “I’m going to pretend that everything is okay.” “I can change to fit in if I have to!” “Who do you think you are to put your thoughts/art/ideas/ beliefs/writing out in the world?” ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=700))
- If you want to kick-start your shame resilience and story-claiming, start with these questions. Figuring out the answers can change your life: Who do you become when you’re backed into that shame corner? How do you protect yourself? Who do you call to work through the mean-nasties or the cry-n-hides or the people-pleasing? What’s the most courageous thing you could do for yourself when you feel small and hurt? ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=850))
- Authenticity is the daily practice of letting go of who we think we’re supposed to be and embracing who we are. ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=880))
- Perfectionism is not self-improvement. Perfectionism is, at its core, about trying to earn approval and acceptance. Most perfectionists were raised being praised for achievement and performance (grades, manners, rule-following, people-pleasing, appearance, sports). Somewhere along the way, we adopt this dangerous and debilitating belief system: I am what I accomplish and how well I accomplish it. Please. Perform. Perfect. Healthy striving is self-focused—How can I improve? Perfectionism is other-focused—What will they think? ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=966))
- Research shows that perfectionism hampers success. In fact, it’s often the path to depression, anxiety, addiction, and life-paralysis.2 Life-paralysis refers to all of the opportunities we miss because we’re too afraid to put anything out in the world that could be imperfect. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=971))
- Perfectionism never happens in a vacuum. It touches everyone around us. We pass it down to our children, we infect our workplace with impossible expectations, and it’s suffocating for our friends and families. ([Location 1039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=1039))
- here’s how I define spirituality: Spirituality is recognizing and celebrating that we are all inextricably connected to each other by a power greater than all of us, and that our connection to that power and to one another is grounded in love and compassion. Practicing spirituality brings a sense of perspective, meaning, and purpose to our lives. ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=1078))
- From this foundation of spirituality, three other significant patterns emerged as being essential to resilience: Cultivating hope Practicing critical awareness Letting go of numbing and taking the edge off vulnerability, discomfort, and pain ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=1086))
- hope is really a thought process made up of what Snyder calls a trilogy of goals, pathways, and agency.4 ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=1094))
- Hopeful self-talk sounds more like, This is tough, but I can do it. ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=1107))
- On the other hand, for those of us who have the tendency to believe that everything worthwhile should involve pain and suffering (like yours truly), I’ve also learned that never fun, fast, and easy is as detrimental to hope as always fun, fast, and easy. ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=1107))
- Is what I’m seeing real? Do these images convey real life or fantasy? Do these images reflect healthy, Wholehearted living, or do they turn my life, my body, my family, and my relationships into objects and commodities? Who benefits by my seeing these images and feeling bad about myself? Hint: This is ALWAYS about money and/or control. ([Location 1133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=1133))
- When I interviewed the participants whom I’d describe as living a Wholehearted life about the same topic, they consistently talked about trying to feel the feelings, staying mindful about numbing behaviors, and trying to lean into the discomfort of hard emotions. ([Location 1159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=1159))
- For many of us, our first response to vulnerability and pain of these sharp points is not to lean into the discomfort and feel our way through but rather to make it go away. We do that by numbing and taking the edge off the pain with whatever provides the quickest relief. We can anesthetize with a whole bunch of stuff, including alcohol, drugs, food, sex, relationships, money, work, caretaking, gambling, staying busy, affairs, chaos, shopping, planning, perfectionism, constant change, and the Internet. ([Location 1167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=1167))
- Again, after years of research, I’m convinced that we all numb and take the edge off. The question is, does our _______________ (eating, drinking, spending, gambling, saving the world, incessant gossiping, perfectionism, sixty-hour workweek) get in the way of our authenticity? Does it stop us from being emotionally honest and setting boundaries and feeling like we’re enough? Does it keep us from staying out of judgment and from feeling connected? Are we using _____________ to hide or escape from the reality of our lives? ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=1200))
- When it comes to gratitude, the word that jumped out at me throughout this research process is practice. ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=1262))
- When we start polling people, it’s often because we don’t trust our own knowing. It feels too shaky and too uncertain. We want assurances and folks with whom we can share the blame if things don’t pan out. I know all about this. I’m a professional pollster—it’s hard for me to go it alone sometimes. When I’m making a difficult decision and feel disconnected from my intuition, I have a tendency to survey everyone around me. Ironically, since doing this research, surveying has become a red flag for me—it tells me that I’m feeling vulnerable about making a decision. ([Location 1400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=1400))
- it’s our fear of the unknown and our fear of being wrong that create most of our conflict and anxiety. ([Location 1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BS03LL6&location=1422))
