- What you learn is that “crucial conversations” transform people and relationships. They are anything but transacted; they create an entirely new level of bonding. They produce what Buddhism calls “the middle way”—not a compromise between two opposites on a straight-line continuum, but a higher middle way, like the apex of a triangle.

- Every time we find ourselves arguing, debating, running away, or otherwise acting in an ineffective way, it’s because we don’t know how to share meaning. Instead of engaging in healthy dialogue, we play silly and costly games. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005K0AYH4&location=547))
- Sometimes we rely on hints, sarcasm, caustic humor, innuendo, and looks of disgust to make our points. We play the martyr and then pretend we’re actually trying to help. Afraid to confront an individual, we blame an entire team for a problem—hoping the message will hit the right target. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005K0AYH4&location=551))
- On other occasions, not knowing how to stay in dialogue, we try to force our meaning into the pool. We rely on violence—anything from subtle manipulation to verbal attacks. We act like we know everything, hoping people will believe our arguments. We discredit others, hoping people won’t believe their arguments. And then we use every manner of force to get our way or possibly even harm others. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005K0AYH4&location=554))
- Skilled people Start with Heart. That is, they begin high-risk discussions with the right motives, and they stay focused no matter what happens. They maintain this focus in two ways. First, they’re steely eyed smart when it comes to knowing what they want. Despite constant invitations to slip away from their goals, they stick with them. Second, skilled people don’t make Fool’s Choices (either/or choices). Unlike others who justify their unhealthy behavior by explaining that they had no choice but to fight or take flight, the dialogue-smart believe that dialogue, no matter the circumstances, is always an option. Let’s look at each of these important ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005K0AYH4&location=652))
- As you begin the discussion, start by examining your motives. Going in, ask yourself what you really want. Also, as the conversation unfolds and you find yourself starting to, say, defer to the boss or give your spouse the cold shoulder, pay attention to what’s happening to your objectives. Are you starting to change your goal to save face, avoid embarrassment, win, be right, or punish others? Here’s the tricky part. Our motives usually change without any conscious thought on our part. When adrenaline does our thinking for us, our motives flow with the chemical tide. ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005K0AYH4&location=738))
- What do I really want for myself? What do I really want for others? What do I really want for the relationship? Once you’ve asked yourself what you want, add one more equally telling question: How would I behave if I really wanted these results?

- your buddy explains. “You cared so deeply about the product timelines that you were blind to the conditions. You know—how people were feeling and acting, what tone they were taking, stuff like that.” ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005K0AYH4&location=847))
- When things start turning ugly, I watch the content of the conversation (the topic under discussion) along with the conditions (what people are doing in response). I look for and examine both what and why. ([Location 850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005K0AYH4&location=850))
