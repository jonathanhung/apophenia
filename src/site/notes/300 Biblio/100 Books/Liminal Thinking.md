## Highlights 
---
- What I learned from Kurt is that beliefs are often the main things standing in the way of change, not only for individuals, but also for teams, families, organizations, nations, and even the world as a whole. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=210))
- These are liminal roles because they are associated with growth and change, which involve breaking, shifting, or otherwise transcending boundaries ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=255))
- A belief is a story in your head, a cause-and-effect chain, like a recipe or rule for action. The basic recipe looks like this: If you have a need, then look for a belief that provides a rule for action to get the result that you want. Many beliefs take the form of “If x, then y.” ([Location 470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=470))
- Changing stories can change reality. ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=528))
- This is the way story webs create a shared world. Learning loops can reinforce good habits and bad habits alike. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=551))
- Liminal thinking is a way to identify limiting beliefs and open yourself to hitherto unseen possibilities that can open new doors. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=595))
- And the longer a group of people have been operating with a shared map, the more likely there will be a mismatch between the map and reality. ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=635))
- The deeper you go in exploring anyone’s belief system (including your own!), the closer you will get to their governing beliefs. The more foundational the belief, the more it will be unconsciously defended by self-sealing logic. This can be a scary place to go. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=712))
- A genuine relationship is one that is not dominated by the ego with its image-making and self-seeking. In a genuine relationship, there is an outward flow of open, alert attention toward the other person in which there is no wanting whatsoever. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=801))
- The most common mistake I see people make in change efforts is to assume that they understand the situation. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=820))
- Good leaders supplement the information that’s coming to them through official channels with a lot of walking around and sense-making on the ground. This is a very difficult thing to do. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=852))
- Spend time with someone and try to listen to them as if you were hearing them for the first time. Empty your cup of all your theories and judgments about that person. Take your ego out of it as completely as you can. Listen as if that were your only goal: to listen. See what happens. • Take 20 minutes out of your day and stop doing anything other than paying attention. Pay attention to your environment, to your surroundings. Pay attention to what people are saying and doing. Notice as much as you can, with all of your senses. Pay attention to your feelings and reactions to what’s happening. What do you notice? ([Location 870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=870))
- SCARF model.1 SCARF is an acronym that stands for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness. ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=933))
- it’s impossible to be angry with a warm cup of tea in your hands. ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=995))
- requires these kinds of safe spaces. It’s not possible to have a meaningful dialogue across belief bubbles if people don’t feel safe, and safe space requires trust. ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=1010))
- • Think back to the last time you had a conflict with someone and use the SCARF model to think through the needs that were involved in that situation. What emotional needs of yours were not being met? What unmet needs do you think they might have had? Think about different ways you might have acted in that situation that might have brought about a different result. • Think of a place where you feel emotionally safe. What are the things that make it feel safe to you? Consider places where you spend time that do not feel emotionally safe, whether it’s home, work, or somewhere else. Now compare it to that safe place. What might you do to make that unsafe place feel safer? ([Location 1023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=1023))
- what makes a good theory, ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=1057))
- What will help is triangulation: the practice of developing multiple viewpoints and theories that you can compare, contrast, combine, and validate, to get a better understanding of what’s going on. ([Location 1098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=1098))
- Most of the time we are all walking around with our heads so full of “obvious” that we can’t see what’s really going on. ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=1118))
- Among other things, he simply walks around and asks people questions, like: “How do you feel about your life?” “Is it everything you wanted it to be?” “If not, why not?” “What do you think is your biggest obstacle?” “What would you like to do in the future?” “What do you think you need to do that?” ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01LZS4SLO&location=1151))
