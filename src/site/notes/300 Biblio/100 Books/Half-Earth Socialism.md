- deploy a radical and untested technology called solar radiation management (SRM) ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=44))
- Rather than seeing SRM as a dangerous and desperate measure, optimists portrayed it as a demonstration of American statesmanship, technology, and entrepreneurial pluck. ([Location 50](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=50))
- SRM could not simply be switched off, because the high concentrations of greenhouse gases would heat the atmosphere all at once in what scientists called ‘termination shock’. ([Location 58](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=58))
- ward off accusations of climate imperialism, ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=68))
- geoengineers claimed that SRM was actually in the interest of poor nations. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=69))
- these events spelled a strange defeat for the environmental movement – strange because for decades it had won victory after victory. With millions demonstrating in the streets for climate justice in the 2010s, environmentalist parties took power in regional and national governments around the world in the 2020s, allowing them to finally realize their dream of ‘green capitalism’. ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=88))
- Proponents of ‘green’ cars (electric, fuel-cell, or hybrid) faced a similar set of contradictory ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=97))
- The problem was that the greens mistook slowing down the pace of the environmental crisis for victory, rather than merely a defeat postponed. After decades of environmentalists’ championing ‘win–win’ solutions for both business and nature, it became clear that making unprofitable decisions was where true freedom lay. ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=103))
- Despite briefly tasting power, the environmentalists accomplished little because they never elucidated how the various facets of the environmental crisis – climate change, pandemics, and mass extinctions – were interlinked; nor did they articulate what a post-crisis society might actually look like. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=160))
- While at times our proposals may seem outlandish – our book, after all, belongs to the utopian tradition – they are meant to encourage those on the Left and in the environmental movement to take seriously the challenge of not merely surviving the next century but creating a better society within a wilder and stabilized biosphere. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=167))
- It is not enough if the market for ‘clean meat’ or renewables grows quickly – their environmentally deleterious competitors must also contract, and this is unlikely to happen if environmental policy is guided by price signals. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=172))
- the physical composition of the global economic metabolism: How much land are we converting from forest to pasture? How much energy are we using, what are its physical properties, and how is it generated? How should we allocate necessary but environmentally costly resources such as steel and concrete? ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=174))
- The epithet ‘neoliberal’ is often a grenade lobbed with the pin attached, because this explosive term is rarely understood by those hurling it. To grasp this controversial and murky ideology, it helps to return to the moment of its genesis as a self-conscious movement. On 10 April 1947, ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=179))
- The conference’s impresario, Friedrich Hayek, saw the price system as a mechanism not merely for exchanging goods but also ‘for communicating information’.33 Markets allowed people to act rationally as individuals without full knowledge of why prices change, which meant that society’s ‘optimal ignorance’ was surprisingly high.34 ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=187))
- If, as they claim, the market produces knowledge better than other institutions – such as science or central planning – then it follows that all of society and nature should be set to the logic of the price system by a neoliberal state. This philosophical shorthand allows neoliberals to diagnose the ills of the world and to propose a slate of prescriptions.35 It allows them to act. ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=192))
- The concept of Half-Earth comes from E. O. Wilson, an entomologist whose research has shown the need to rewild half of the planet to staunch the haemorrhaging of biodiversity. While global warming, poaching, and invasive species decimate flora and fauna, Wilson stresses that the greatest driver of extinction remains habitat loss. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=201))
- Robert MacArthur discovered a simple mathematical relationship between land area and biodiversity. In their study of island biogeography, they found that the number of species was roughly proportional to the fourth root of the area.38 This meant that, all things being equal, there were fewer species on small islands than on large ones. Decades later, Wilson realized that nature preserves were the terrestrial equivalents of islands. As 15 per cent of the world’s land area is presently protected (plus a measly 2 per cent of the ocean), only half of all species will survive the Sixth Extinction. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=204))
- To create a global ark able to protect 84 per cent of species, then 50 per cent of Earth needs to be protected (0.50.25 = 0.84). ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=209))
- Yet Wilson fails to see that Half-Earth must be socialist if it is ever to exist. Such an enormous reform would quickly run up against entrenched economic interests, from mining firms to ranchers, many of whom would be willing to bloody their hands to protect their bottom line. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=213))
- Much of the book is dedicated to debunking panaceas beloved across much of the political spectrum, such as nuclear power, geoengineering, ‘green growth’, and carbon capture and storage. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=219))
- Proceeding along the same three levels of analysis, another budding futurist could make judgements that differ from ours. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=358))
- For too long the Left has been better at critique than creating its own positive proposals. In the rare chance that they take power, socialists will falter and fall without a programme to guide the transition beyond capitalism. Half-Earth socialism, we hope, is a vision of the future that can develop into a total alternative to capitalism, including everything from a plan for resource allocation to an outline of what life will feel like. We invite everyone from all liberatory traditions to join us in the revolutionary kitchen to think up many new recipes and work together to realize them. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=364))
- In the Sonoran Desert there are ziggurats of glass and steel, a gleaming facility that looks like a Martian space station. Biosphere 2, as it is called, lies just beyond the exurban edge of Tucson in the hamlet of Oracle, but once it seemed to be the centre of the world. It was designed as a closed system able to produce its own atmosphere, plant life, and water cycle by mimicking the delicate balance of Biosphere 1 (i.e., Earth). This monument to pharaonic ecology was built in 1989 by members of a commune established twenty years before – the Synergia Ranch – where everyone was to some extent a thespian, cybernetician, gardener, sailor, and entrepreneur. John Allen, the commune’s leader, was the driving force behind Biosphere 2, but it was Ed Bass, another denizen of the Synergia Ranch and scion of a Texan oil dynasty, who bankrolled it. Bass and Allen, who each exhibited a hippie’s heart and a businessman’s brain, hoped to understand the natural world while earning a tidy profit. In the future, they believed, either the environmental crisis would displace humanity to the stars or a nuclear war would drive the species underground. Their firm, Space Biospheres Ventures, was intended to cater to both markets. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=375))
- The most important lesson salvaged from the wreckage of Biosphere 2 is the impossibility of controlling ecological systems even of a modest size. Shortly after the second mission, scientists argued in Science that the experiment made clear ‘no one yet knows how to engineer systems that provide humans with the life-supporting services that natural ecosystems produce for free … Despite its mysteries and hazards, Earth remains the only known home that can sustain life.’13 Yet it seems that few have learned from Bass and Allen’s folly. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=429))
- In this chapter we attempt to establish a system of thought fit for an age of environmental catastrophe. We begin by asking: What can we know? To what degree do we understand nature? What are the consequences of our ignorance, both to ourselves and to the natural world? These questions are similar to those posed by Friedrich Hayek about the economy in the 1930s and 1940s, in his effort to re-found liberalism as neoliberalism. By arguing that humanity could never comprehend the market, he endowed the economic sphere with ecological attributes – it appeared as a natural self-organizing system. We follow his example of digging deep into the epistemic layers of our beliefs, but whereas Hayek covered the market with the veil of ignorance, we drape that veil over nature. But what are the social, economic, and political implications of the impossibility of fully knowing nature? To answer this question, we take leave of 1990s Arizona and travel across the Atlantic Ocean and back two centuries to trace the origins of modern environmental thought. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=443))
- Yet, tucked between the folds of these better-known events, G. W. F. Hegel, Thomas Malthus, and Edward Jenner wrote texts that would in time come to define the three main environmental paradigms. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=455))
- Each of these thinkers is a primogenitor of one of the three great lineages in environmental thought: Hegel’s Prometheanism, Malthusianism, and Jennerite ecological scepticism. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=460))
- The humanization of nature is the process by which humanity overcomes its alienation from nature by instilling the latter with human consciousness through the process of labour – transforming wilderness into a garden. ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=474))
- True history, Hegel would come to argue, could only start once the opposition between nature and humanity had been reconciled through labour, that is, through the redirection of nature to human ends. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=492))
- What is more relevant for us is Jenner’s explanation of why smallpox and its ilk existed at all. He argued that diseases were the result of humanity’s unnatural domination of animals: ‘The deviation of Man from the state in which he was originally placed by Nature seems to have proved to him a prolific source of Diseases.’35 He was the first to posit that the attempt to control nature allowed new illnesses to emerge. Jenner saw that any animal used for any purpose might become a vector for disease: ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=518))
- In a revealing passage, Marx wrote that for man, ‘in the working-up of the objective world … nature appears as his work and his reality … for he duplicates himself not only, as in consciousness, intellectually, but also actively, in reality, and therefore he contemplates himself in a world he has created.’ ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=544))
    - Note: Narcissism: can only see one’s vision and the other is a fear one does not want to contend with. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Marx has a reputation as a ‘Promethean’, that is, he is seen as a thinker who believes that the total control of nature is necessary for human freedom. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=551))
- Marx’s Prometheanism stemmed not from a disagreement with Jenner (whom he never mentioned), but from his rancour towards the anti-utopianism of Malthus, ‘that master in plagiarism’ and ‘professional sycophant of the landed aristocracy’, ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=561))
- Paul Ehrlich’s The Population Bomb (1968). The young lepidopterologist had become obsessed with the problem of population after a vacation in India, where he was horrified to encounter ‘people eating, people washing, people sleeping. People visiting, arguing, and screaming. People thrusting their hands through the taxi window, begging. People defecating and urinating. People clinging to buses. People herding animals. People, people, people, people.’65 Infamously, Ehrlich’s book begins with the prediction that ‘the battle to feed all of humanity is over … in the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked on now.’66 Doom sells well – with some 2 million books sold and twenty invitations to Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show, Ehrlich soon became a household name. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=604))
- There are different variants of Malthusianism, but often little separates the genocidal from the respectable strains. This split can be found in the example of Malthus himself, who condoned starvation for poor Britons, but was appalled by the genocide of Indigenous nations in North America – a tragedy that he blamed on American population growth. ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=618))
- Jenner recognized animal husbandry as one of the most consequential and dangerous ways humans shape life on Earth. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=642))
- The Jennerite solution to the problem of disease is to undo much of the humanization of nature and leave it forever incomplete. This is less a philosophical nicety than a matter of public health. After the 2003 SARS epidemic, the American Journal of Public Health published an opinion piece demanding a change in how ‘humans treat animals – most basically, ceasing to eat them or, at the very least, radically limiting the quantity of them that are eaten’ as a basic measure of disease prevention. ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=654))
- Capitalism marks a break in human history because the pace and direction of progress – the humanization of nature – have been usurped by capital. Unlike in previous historical eras, we now live in a society driven by the capitalization of nature, because humans no longer consciously direct this process. In this way, Marxists and neoliberals share a strikingly similar understanding of the market as an unconscious, all-powerful force, the difference being that the former abhor it, while it is worshipped by the latter. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=682))
- For Marx, capital is less a thing than a set of social relations. ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=687))
- Pressures from the market dehumanize the capitalist, reducing her to the hybrid creature Marx called ‘capital personified and endowed with consciousness and a will’. ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=711))
- We refuse to understand the relationships that underlie the commodities that we use on a daily basis.1 –Angela Davis ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=973))
- Although Utopians ‘count hunting the lowest, the vilest, and most abject part of butchery’ and regard taking pleasure in death ‘a cruel affection of mind’, free citizens still ate meat and foisted the degrading act of slaughter onto the slave caste. ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=992))
- Whatever the shortcomings of the utopian tradition, its strength lies in the capacity to link food, land, ecology, and politics within a single analytical frame – an approach sorely lacking now. By contrast, none of the big three environmentalist ‘solutions’ today offer a similarly interconnected approach. Instead, mainstream environmentalists approach the environmental crisis as a set of discrete technical problems, addressable through piecemeal reform, while leaving the capitalist foundation of society untouched. ([Location 1024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1024))
- These three demi-utopias are bioenergy carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS); greater nuclear power; and a colonial Half-Earth. ([Location 1027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1027))
    - Note: Introduces critiques of three demi utopia - partial but incomplete visions - BECCS, nuclear, and half earth colonialism. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- study in 2018 found that if a BECCS programme were constrained by the nine essential ‘planetary boundaries’ (such as fresh water, biodiversity, etc.), then it would sequester a measly 0.5 per cent of annual emissions.29 An effective BECCS programme that could sequester several gigatonnes of carbon would need at least 350 million hectares – an area larger than India.30 At this scale of deployment, BECCS would actually increase global deforestation and exacerbate the Sixth Extinction.31 Ironically, destroying so much habitat might make BECCS a net source for greenhouse gases.32 So much for negative emissions. ([Location 1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1075))
- While Half-Earth is supported by the relatively small community of conservationists, and the expansion of nuclear power is championed by high-profile environmentalists, BECCS seems to have only climate modellers as advocates. ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1091))
    - Note: Climate modelers and engineering types like to live in the technical utopia of carbon capture technologies. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Utopias are meant to free one’s conception of the possible, but demi-utopias like BECCS are fictional futures imagined to safeguard the status quo. ([Location 1096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1096))
    - Note: 🔥 [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- It has been estimated that there is currently a 50 per cent chance of a disaster on the scale of Fukushima or worse every sixty-two years, and of Three Mile Island every fifteen.41 If Hansen got his way and thousands of new reactors were built, then there would almost certainly be two, three, many Fukushimas (to paraphrase Che Guevara). ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1113))
    - Note: Deaths from nuclear reactor accidents understated [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- There is good reason to be sceptical of the pro-nuclear environmentalists’ second claim of nuclear power being ‘carbon-neutral’. There is a wide range in estimates of nuclear power’s carbon impact because few agree on how much carbon is released during the mining and processing of uranium, decommissioning of reactors, and permanent storage of toxic waste.51 This is why these assessments vary from 1.4 to 288 grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour (gCO2/kWh), with a mean of 66 gCO2/kWh.52 By comparison, solar power and wind can have a carbon footprint as low as 1 gCO2/kWh (depending on technology, longevity, and location) with the mean of 49.9 gCO2/kWh for solar and 34.1 gCO2/kWh for wind. ([Location 1139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1139))
- Nuclear’s problem is that the mining phase of its life cycle is set to become ever more carbon-intensive. Most power plants today rely on uranium ore of 0.15 per cent purity, which translates to 34 gCO2/kWh. Yet once available ore quality declines to 0.15–0.01 per cent, carbon emissions jump up to 60 gCO2/kWh.55 While this is not expected to happen until the 2060s at current rates of extraction, this cliff will arrive much sooner if a build-out occurs on the scale Hansen advocates. ([Location 1148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1148))
    - Note: Nuclear’s cost to extract, and emissions, will scale with difficulty [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- In the case of conservation, the acid is colonial Malthusianism and the fruit is the protection of thousands of species from extinction. Given that the main driver of the Sixth Extinction is land-use change, conservation is essential to our eco-socialist utopia. Our criticism of conservation’s colonial past is hardly novel, but unlike other critics we delve specifically into the history of Half-Earth to try to salvage the idea for socialism.74 ([Location 1205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1205))
- While E. O. Wilson popularized Half-Earth with his 2016 book of the same name, our narrative mainly focuses on prior environmentalist campaigns. ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1210))
- before Wilson’s book, the WILD Foundation appointed Harvey Locke, a Canadian conservationist, to head its ‘Nature Needs Half’ campaign because he had worked on the idea early in his career. Under his leadership, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) decided in 2005 to fight for preserving half of Canada – an unprecedented target. ([Location 1211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1211))
- This organization had been set up in 1991 by Earth First! co-founder Dave Foreman, the biologist Michael E. Soulé (a student of Paul Ehrlich), and Douglas Tompkins (the fashion mogul behind The North Face and Esprit).75 Rather than engage in direct-action campaigns like Earth First!, the Wildlands Network focused on drafting blueprints of a rewilded North America. In 1992, one of the group’s leading members, Reed Noss, made the case in Wild Earth (their house magazine) for rewilding 50 per cent of the continent. His reason for such an ambitious target was the need to ‘restore viable populations of large carnivores and natural disturbance regimes’. ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1215))
- In the foxhole of the environmental crisis, one is either a Marxist or a Malthusian. ([Location 1234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1234))
    - Note: 🔥 [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- He is a bogeyman for the Left because of his book Sociobiology, which naturalized sexual and cultural differences.91 Apart from this admittedly reactionary research programme, Wilson is a centre-Left Democrat who thinks that policy nudges and the generosity of enlightened philanthropists suffice to achieve planetary conservation.92 Regardless of his politics, his scientific work on island biogeography has withstood more than five decades of scrutiny. There is simply no way to stop the Sixth Extinction other than expanding nature preserves (under Indigenous leadership wherever possible). ([Location 1265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1265))
- Nuclear power, BECCS, and the Half-Earth as promoted by Wilson and Locke have more in common with SRM than with Half-Earth socialism. They are promoted as a partial cure without addressing either the environmental crisis as a whole or its capitalist drivers. Their very point is to preserve as much of the status quo as possible, but such political minimalism courts disaster. ([Location 1478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1478))
- While not sufficient on its own to plan something as complex as an economy (as we will discuss further in this chapter), linear programming was a conceptual breakthrough. ([Location 1551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1551))
- Linear programming offered a systematic way to allocate resources, so that it optimized some metrics of overall national well-being (which we will explore later). ([Location 1554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1554))
- In many ways, Kantorovich embodied the optimism of the period, where rapid economic growth, the new universal science of ‘cybernetics’, and the space age seemed to herald the coming of an abundant and humane socialism.22 Yet despite these seemingly promising conditions, Kantorovich’s ideas were never implemented on a national scale. ([Location 1589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1589))
- Creating plans based on in natura calculation and putting them to a vote would demystify the economy, making it more difficult for a selfish bureaucratic caste to obscure and thus control its workings. ([Location 1621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1621))
- Creating a just world that fits within ecological constraints is the Road of Life that humanity must cross in the twenty-first century. During the siege of Leningrad, Kantorovich understood that trucks would crash through the ice if they were loaded too heavily, but if they were loaded too lightly, more people would freeze or starve. Half-Earth socialism requires a similar balancing act, supplying everyone with the material foundations for a good life – sustenance, shelter, education, art, health – while protecting the biosphere from destabilization. ([Location 1633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1633))
- ‘Integrated Assessment Models’ (IAMs) which combine physics, chemistry, biology, and economics into a single simulation of the world for the next 300 or so years. The IAMs used by the IPCC are usually a combination of a ‘global general equilibrium model’ (i.e., supply and demand are balanced across different markets) and a simulation of the climate, biosphere, and other natural systems. For example, the model might calculate global demand for energy, the resulting pollution created by that demand, and the effect those emissions have on the economy. ([Location 1643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1643))
- because IAMs rely on the universal equivalent of money (even transforming CO2 into cash via a carbon tax), and BECCS is a useful way to transform dollars into negative emissions within the model. Give a BECCS plantation x dollars a year, likely from a carbon tax, and you will sequester y kilograms of carbon from the atmosphere. ([Location 1653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1653))
    - Note: When the denominator relies on dollars to exchange, makes for an easy algebra formula. However, doing so cannot weigh out competing concerns without the dollar being present. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- need a radical global modelling predicated on what Neurath called ‘scientific utopianism’. For him, ‘utopia’ did not refer to ‘impossible happenings’ but a ‘thoughtful order of life’ that did not yet exist. ([Location 1673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1673))
- Utopias were not so different from the ‘constructions of engineers’, akin to detailed blueprints for an imagined society, and thus the utopians could justifiably be called ‘social engineers’. ([Location 1676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1676))
- A utopian’s aims might even include ‘nonhuman ideals’.36 Although what Neurath had in mind included ‘the greatness of God’ and ‘the nation’, expanding the conception of the good beyond humanity allows planning to incorporate ecological goals.

- Let’s start with understanding in natura calculation. It does not mean replacing money with an inefficient barter economy (x kilowatt-hours of power equals y bushels of grain) but rather with an information system that sees how different goods relate to one another as a whole. Meeting the needs of nature and humanity is fundamentally a material goal, measured in food and carbon molecules, and seeing the world in natural units allows us to directly confront trade-offs without the obfuscation of money. ([Location 1690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1690))
- many of these plans rely excessively on Marx’s concept of ‘labour time’ ([Location 1695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1695))

- the goal of socialism is to allow humanity to consciously regulate itself and its interchange with nature. ([Location 1701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1701))
- Neurath portrayed socialist democracy as choosing one among several competing ‘total plans’ devised by the social engineers. Each total plan represents a distinct vision of how the productive capacity of society can be deployed. Neurath was never especially clear on how to devise such plans, but linear programming would be a powerful, albeit rather blunt, tool that would allow in natura planners to translate abstract goals into a concrete vision. At this point we can begin our work as social engineers, ([Location 1703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1703))
- Before the new regime starts the hard work of planning the entire economy, they commission social engineers to do some quick calculations on balancing human needs with planetary boundaries and assign them to the new ‘Gosplant’ bureau (forgive us). Gosplant’s initial goal is to devise several futures that illuminate how much of nature can or should be humanized to furnish the global economy with the necessary resources. ([Location 1709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1709))
- The scientific corpus on planetary boundaries allows Gosplant planners to mathematically express two essential restrictions: limiting extraction to keep the biosphere healthy, while equitably distributing enough natural resources to supply human needs. ([Location 1717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1717))
    - Note: Are the needs of human beings too diverse that such a trade off calculation would be technically infeasible? Or are needs relatively simple - water, food, shelter - while our wants are too many? [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Energy and food production entail significant environmental costs that must be simulated in any global model. To plan for consumption in these two sectors, Gosplant will make several plans with different power quotas, like that proposed by the 2000-Watt Society we encountered in chapter two, and ensure that everyone in the world will have access to a nutritious diet. These choices, like many of Gosplant’s other constraints, are all social decisions. Some scholars have ventured energy quotas lower than 500 watts, which is less than a twentieth of current US usage. This is not to say these more conservative targets are impossible – they would just require spartan restrictions on new clothing, appliances, transportation, electricity, and living space. ([Location 1730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1730))
- The final piece of the puzzle is called the objective function: the quantity that the linear programming algorithm must maximize or minimize. A capitalist firm might decide to minimize costs when running a linear programming algorithm on its own operations; the Gosplant planners, on the other hand, might opt to minimize land use, carbon emissions, or some other metric that combines multiple goals. The linear programming model will then output the best mixture of energy and food sources with respect to this objective function, or tell the user that the plan is not possible within the given constraints. ([Location 1743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1743))
- Linear programming is only a tool, but it is one that allows the Neurathian politics of seeing and democratically deciding which trade-offs to accept. ([Location 1756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1756))
    - Note: Creating visions alternative futures and courses of actions, collective (democratic) decision making on the mathematical and life-style trade offs for accelerating parts of the technical economy (eg green transport) and collectively down-scaling aspects currently over-contributing to emissions and climate change.

- Having just two metrics to measure the world – land use and carbon emissions – skirts close to pseudorationalism, though it is enough for a toy example. ([Location 1758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1758))
- The long-term energy goals of Half-Earth socialism are apparent: total electrification of industry and transportation and making generous use of clean hydrogen where fuels remain necessary, with all power supplied by relatively power-dense wind and solar. Hydroelectricity, tidal energy, and geothermal energy may be useful, but they would always play a limited role in a renewable energy system. Ideally, such a society would not use any biofuels and would rely on batteries for back-stop power instead (though biodiesel back-up generators at hospitals and the like might be wise). ([Location 1803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1803))
- Half-Earth socialism will need to dedicate humanity’s full productive capacity to realize this future as soon as possible, for this transition won’t be easy. One study estimates that a renewable world would require 3.8 million 5-megawatt wind turbines (supplying 50 per cent of global electricity and covering 1.17 per cent of total land area); 1.7 billion 3-kilowatt rooftop solar panels; 89,000 300-megawatt solar plants, a little over half of which would use concentrated solar power, with the remainder using photovoltaic cells (all solar sources would make up 40 per cent of global electricity and take up 0.29 per cent of land area, not counting rooftop panels); and tidal, hydroelectric, and geothermal energy producing the remaining 10 per cent of electricity.55 Unmentioned are the massive investments required for a hydrogen industry and public transit. The transformation would be extraordinary: supplying the necessary electricity would require a 40-fold increase in wind power and a 170-fold increase in photovoltaics as of 2015.56 ([Location 1807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1807))

- Like some early IAMs, such as William Nordhaus’ Bank of Sweden Prize–winning DICE model, our programme is basic enough to run on an ordinary laptop in less than a second. We can set several constraints, including an energy quota; various planetary boundaries, such as global temperature or the amount of land set aside for wildlife; and the state of infrastructure and industry (e.g., to what extent are they electrified?). Full details of the toy model are given in the appendix at the back of the book. While the dream of full electrification is apparent in the long term, if the revolution happened tomorrow, then Gosplant would have to decide whether to minimize land use or CO2 emissions, in addition to setting energy and food quotas. The numbers underpinning these variables are based on the current state of technology in various fields – so no cold fusion or fast-breeders.

- Imagine that, for the short term, the global parliament opts for the second modified plan with a 1,500-watt energy quota and restrictions on fuel use. It is the best fit for present circumstances while allowing energy use to grow in the future as more sustainable infrastructures are built. (That quota would seem austere in the Global North, though relatively painless for the South.) The government agrees to steadily reduce private car ownership to the point of complete abolition, one compacted Ferrari at a time. The steel thus saved can be recycled into trams and buses, while the remaining cars (which would run on electricity, hydrogen, or biofuels) are pooled and signed out by individuals or families. While Gosplant liquidates the suburban real estate market early on, millions of construction workers and tradespeople find work retrofitting buildings to conserve energy and adapting private mansions and corporate headquarters to communal use. Private lawns and golf courses are likewise either rewilded or turned into community gardens. Wide-ranging improvements to industrial processes to reduce pollution, fuel use, and waste are undertaken in just about every industry. Large swathes of manufacturing become rationalized when ‘planned obsolescence’ itself is made obsolete. Resources are redirected towards building solar panels, wind turbines, super-efficient insulation, and railways. Immediately after the Half-Earth socialist revolution, much of the world’s pasture is converted into biofuel plantations for the short-term decarbonization of transportation and industry, while the remainder is rewilded, which in turn requires an expanded cadre of ecologists and foresters trained in both conventional science and traditional Indigenous knowledge.

- In Natura Democracy ([Location 1882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1882))
- Despite his espousal of ‘total plans’ to co-ordinate society, Neurath was deeply sceptical of technocracy. ‘People of the totalitarian kind may try to make scientists the leaders of a new society’, he warned, ‘like the magicians, nobles, or churchmen of former societies.’ ([Location 1883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1883))
- Neurath innovated new methods of communication and education to ward off such a threat. He believed that even something as complex as the economy could be made comprehensible to everyone, and that this was indeed the precondition for socialist democracy. ([Location 1885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1885))
    - Note: The pre-condition of democracy was to make legible the economy, so that anyone could comprehend and make decisions about it. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Neurath wore many hats – that of philosopher, economic historian, planner – but he saw his role as curator as essential to inculcating class consciousness. During World War I, he not only worked as a military planner in Vienna but also directed Leipzig’s Museum of War Economy, which explained the war effort to the German public. ([Location 1888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1888))
- Instead of giving pride of place to rare objects, Neurath’s museum exhibitions were almost entirely composed of charts and graphs illustrating various economic indices. To this end, he devised ISOTYPE (International System Of TYpographic Picture Education), a graphic language designed to convey complex economic information not only to Austria’s working class but even to people who could not read German (or read at all). ([Location 1894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1894))
    - Note: ISOTYPE: A design or pattern language for facets of the economy. Alphabet? [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Neurath thought that a visual language could democratize reason by making the essence of an economic problem apparent to non-experts.

- the actions taken to control one part will in turn feed back and have their own effect on the system – for example, fully electrifying public transit reduces the need for biofuels and increases the need for solar panels and energy storage, freeing up more land for rewilding while simultaneously increasing pressure on the grid.

- Soviet cybernetics could only take place within the more pragmatic military sphere because these new fields were seen as a ‘reactionary pseudoscience’ by Stalinist scholars.68 In 1958, cybernetics not only was rehabilitated but forced the spring of Soviet planning theory. ([Location 1949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1949))
- Complex systems can often be modelled using differential equations, and control theory is used to gently adjust their behaviour so that the change over time goes as planned. Controlling a system usually involves a constant stream of input data, which is used to constantly correct the system in real time. Control theory can be thought of as our fictional car’s cruise-control system, which monitors and adjusts speed many times as it takes in data from the wheels and engine to maintain a consistent outcome or speed. The result is a model that is continuously refined through feedback (e.g., information from the chassis) and has built-in flexibility to plan for change and contingency over time (say, a shifting slope), all in service of a pre-defined outcome (the speed limit). Perhaps you can already see how useful this would be for planning Half-Earth socialism. ([Location 1966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1966))
- in the Soviet context Kantorovich was right to be suspicious. The cyberneticians were, like Wiener, based primarily in the military and thought about the economy as a machine to control, while mathematical economists like Kantorovich favoured optimization (with some caveats). Kantorovich understood that programming the USSR in one shot was a hopeless task and criticized a group of rival economists who were behind a programme called the System for the Optimal Functioning of the Economy (SOFE), which he believed relied too heavily on centralized optimization.72 Instead, Kantorovich realized that optimization had to occur on multiple scales, both in space and time, with a vast number of models loosely connected to one another. Regional governments would have leeway over how the local economy operated, so long as it met the broad conditions set by the national plan. ‘It is neither possible nor necessary to attempt to describe in detail and build all at once a final, all-encompassing system of models of the national economy’, he reflected. ‘It must obviously originate on the basis of a complex of individual models and tasks.’ The goal was not a single model, but a ‘single complex of interconnected models’ designed with enough autonomy to ‘provide working people and managers of individual levels and sectors of the economy broad opportunities to display their initiative.’73 This multilayered planning is perfect for working within a natural and social world with enormous variation in ecology, climate, and needs in different areas. ([Location 1976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=1976))
    - Note: Kanto preferred local, distributed control of the economy - where everyday people could author, choose from and calibrate their plans in their context - at various “levels and scales”. What is meant by levels and scales specifically?
      Fractal, interconnected planned economies. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Kantorovich, on the other hand, envisioned factories and farms independently using the parameters from the linear programming algorithm to plan their production, not unlike a price system but without a universal equivalent guiding economic decisions.

    - Note: Was against universal plans lacking contextual factors and universal measures for exchange. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- This is related to the second point, which is that Kantorovich’s multilevel approach reduces the amount of information needed to make the plan work. Hayek’s argument that a planned economy requires ‘one single mind possessing all the information’ was either naive or cynical, but it is not a convincing rebuttal to Kantorovich’s vision of socialism.77 Thirdly, and perhaps more importantly, these loosely connected models create space for democracy, diversity, and political initiative, all unified in pursuit of national or even global goals. Such an approach is superior to what tends to be on offer in socialist political theory: either tiny but loosely connected anarchist communes or a top-down authoritarian structure.

- Stafford Beer. Like Wiener, Beer was keenly read by his Soviet peers, but Beer was an unusual cybernetician in his deep commitment to democratic control systems.78 He was not a typical socialist but looked the part of a 1970s business hippie – being a management consultant with a beard of biblical proportions – but he was far more like Neurath and Kantorovich than like Stewart Brand or Ed Bass. Beer believed that controlling ‘exceedingly complex systems … indescribable in detail’ was the central problem of the mid-twentieth century.79 This might sound Hayekian, but Beer distinguished himself from the neoliberals in believing that such systems could be controlled – even something as complicated as the economy – so long as the controller was itself complex enough to fairly represent the system.

- viable system model in the early 1970s. The details are complicated, but the basic principle is that planning could be performed by a five-part, loosely hierarchical system.81 As historian Eden Medina describes it, the first level of the system is the ‘sensory level’, similar to the parts of the body in contact with the outside environment.82 Just as lungs breathe without conscious intervention, nodes on the first level usually operate without much input from the rest of the system. Individual groups of workers are capable of managing their own affairs, as the heart, lungs, and liver do. The second level is a support system for level one, which Medina calls the ‘cybernetic spinal cord’, connecting the different nodes on level one together in communication. The main purpose of the second level is to help organize level one’s activity, allowing the different nodes to ‘coordinate their actions and adapt to one another’s behavior’, as well as filtering out important information to send up to level three.83 This third level was likened by Beer to the parts of the brain that regulate basic bodily function, the brainstem and cerebellum, in that it manages the operation of the first two levels. The third level has access to a detailed picture of daily activity and can thus co-ordinate the actions of the nodes on the first level, intervene when necessary, and send important information up to the fourth and fifth levels of the system. The fourth level is where Gosplant would live, as it is where medium- and long-term plans are devised. As Medina notes, because daily management is affected by plans with a longer horizon, ‘Beer did not see System Four as the boss of System Three but rather as its partner in an ongoing conversation.’ ([Location 2018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=2018))
- Unlike Kantorovich (but like Neurath), Beer had the opportunity to put his ideas into practice at scale. Beer’s apotheosis from mere theorist to socialist immortal occurred not because of his influence on Gosplan or CEMI but through his participation in the ill-fated utopian ‘Project Cybersyn’ (or ‘Synco’ in Spanish). Although Chile in the early 1970s might seem far removed from the global crises in the 2020s, Cybersyn is perhaps the closest historical analogue to Half-Earth socialism. Beer designed the system to manage Chile’s state-owned industries as part of President Salvador Allende’s peaceful transition to socialism. ([Location 2037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=2037))
    - Note: Beer’s project “Cybersyn” influenced 1970s planned economy of Chile. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Beer’s model was designed to manage any complex system, whether the internal operations of a company or the co-ordination of an entire economy, and therefore could be based on natural units rather than money. ([Location 2047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=2047))
- Beer never had a chance to improve on Cybersyn’s design because the programme soon came to an abrupt and bloody end. After years of destabilizing the economy and pressuring the army to overthrow Allende’s government, Washington finally got the coup it wanted in 1973. Without a Road of Life to help his government endure the fascist siege of the presidential palace, Allende shot himself. Beer was fortunate to leave Chile alive. One of the first acts of the newly installed junta was to destroy Cybersyn; a soldier even stabbed the transparencies in the central operations room.

- The new tyrant, Augusto Pinochet, created a marketized society protected by a strong, ruthless state. Death squads crushed the Left, while economists trained at the University of Chicago oversaw sweeping privatizations. While the ‘Chicago boys’ have become infamous in the history of neoliberalism, it is less well known that the CIA’s goal of creating a ‘coup climate’ was largely the work of assistant secretary of defence Warren Nutter, who was Chicago School leader Milton Friedman’s first graduate student.94 To codify the new order, Chile drafted a new constitution in 1980 that not only was inspired by Hayek’s legal treatise outlining a market society free from democratic constraints, but even adopted its name – the Constitution of Liberty.

- If people do not have a say in how the economy is consciously managed, then even the most technical and ecological planning will degenerate into tyranny. This is why any attempt to revive the utopian dream of a consciously planned economy, such as Half-Earth socialism, must reckon with the failures of past socialist societies.

- he argued that socialism inevitably led towards a shortage economy.108 The causes were myriad but ultimately boiled down to the way individuals behave in a planned economy. While capitalist firms are motivated by maximizing profit, socialist firms were primarily motivated by satisfying output quotas set by a bureaucracy. This led to pathological behaviours, such as duplicated capacity, where firms created their own additional productive units to secure small batches of supplies because they did not trust other factories to produce necessary intermediate goods. This made output more reliable but negated any gains from economies of scale. While an inefficient capitalist enterprise is punished by going under, the inefficient socialist firm had only the Party to fear – and the Party had interests other than efficiency (as Kantorovich knew only too well). The underperforming but favoured firm would always receive help, while a well-run factory could be shut down if it antagonized a powerful patron.109 ([Location 2192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=2192))
    - Note: János Kornai, argued that incentivizing firms towards a planned bureaucracy will always necessarily generate nepotism and favoritism which smuggles in corruption and complacency which a market system may snuff out. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Kornai contrasted socialism’s congenital problem of shortage with capitalism’s tendency to surplus. Profit encourages firms to produce more than what is needed. Indeed, capitalist growth rates have slowed over the past half century in part because the most dynamic sectors, such as manufacturing, have productive capacities that far outstrip demand.110 Even Larry Summers, a paragon of the establishment, recognizes capitalism’s tendency towards ‘secular stagnation’.111 In fact, the environmental crisis itself could be considered an inevitable consequence of capitalist overproduction, where too much of nature has been humanized, to the point of destabilizing capitalism itself. From this point of view, the most natural solution may very well be a socialist system that errs on the side of shortage. Socialism’s unification of the economic and ([Location 2201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=2201))
    - Note: Capitalism tends towards surplus while socialism tends towards shortage. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- one can concede to the neoliberals that even the best plans based on the most up-to-date information will not be as dynamic as the price system. As a result, the tendency towards shortage that Kornai diagnoses will likely emerge in some form. Socialism involves certain trade-offs that are inseparable from the system itself, just as the dynamism of capitalism goes hand in hand with inequality, unemployment, and ecological devastation.

- ‘Carmen probably told you about food credits’, she said. ‘There’s a bit of a market socialist system when it comes to all the little things people need. Planners experiment with prices until there’s a match between supply, demand, and environmental costs. Coffee and cocoa are a tad pricey, what with transportation, but since they keep for so long they’re not as expensive as tropical fruit. We get oranges from Florida in the winter, but not many. On the other hand, we’ve got plenty of local berries here that I never knew about before. Grains and local fruits and vegetables are the cheapest, and in the winter people often eat food they canned themselves. Everyone has more than enough credits to meet their needs, but it’s up to them what they eat. ([Location 2655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=2655))
- William Morris, one of the wealthiest men in Victorian England, spent his life translating Viking sagas, weaving, writing, and fighting for a socialist revolution.

- Morris recognized that utopia was hardly an impractical romance to be discarded by tough-minded revolutionaries, but rather a necessary part of the practical work to realize socialism. ([Location 2742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08L5VD33V&location=2742))
- Half-Earth socialist planning is inspired by a slew of traditions, including Neurath’s in natura calculation, Kantorovich’s linear programming, Beer’s Cybersyn, and the climate-economy models of Austria’s IIASA.
