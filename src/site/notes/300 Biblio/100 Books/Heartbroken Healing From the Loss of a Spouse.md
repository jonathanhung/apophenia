- Human beings are both emotional and rational beings. Some of us operate more on emotion, while others trust more in reason. Which one tends to dominate and how much depends on a variety of factors like background, experience, gifts, talents, and personality. Each of us has a natural sort of equilibrium, a balance of emotion and reason that we settle into in the midst of routine, everyday life.
  When grief strikes, this equilibrium is upended. Our usual balance of emotion-reason cracks under the strain. The heart exerts itself, and emotion floods our being.
  As Sam put it, “I never knew I was capable of feeling such things. I’m suddenly an emotional basket case. I’m not myself at all.”
  The truth is, Sam was still himself, but he was in a very different situation. Something traumatic occurred. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn8mpx8afy81sef7cpz2b2xs))
- “There’s no one else like him. The intimacy we enjoyed was special. We were true partners,” Betty shared.
  “I especially loved all the playful, verbal bantering. It was so much fun. I even made a list of words we used in our everyday conversation.”
  Betty paused and sighed.
  “Goodness, I miss his voice,” she said.
  The power of the human voice is extraordinary. Like the eyes, the voice uniquely expresses our hearts and minds. It’s one of the first things many bereaved spouses say they miss.
  What your mate said, and how, is deeply imbedded in your soul. His words are weighty and powerful.
  His voice may be silent to your ear, but not to your heart. He still speaks to you. His words linger. Treasure them.
  “I miss your voice, but I hear it deep inside. I’ll treasure your words.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn8mshw2cwvah5mf1hy97pg5))
- “My Dreams Are Gone”
  “My dreams are gone. Anything I thought I wanted to do disappeared. The goals are no more. It was all tied to him,” Renee said.
  “I miss the future – our future. It’s not there anymore,” she shared.
  When your spouse passed, your future turned upside down. Anything you had planned together has been erased. Dreams, hopes, and goals died with him.
  Grief is an earthquake in the heart. The aftershocks continue. You’ll be experiencing them for a while. Life may feel shaky and uncertain.
  Now you’re faced with not only huge loss, but massive rebuilding. That won’t happen quickly. Don’t get in a hurry. This isn’t a sprint.
  As you focus on grieving well, you’ll be able later to handle the challenges of remaking the future – one step at a time.
  My dreams are shattered. I’ll grieve in healthy ways and retool the future when it’s time.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn8mv5d07ttmag39h5ewjb22))
- “She was the most wonderful woman. Words can’t express how much I loved her. She’s gone, and now there’s a hole where my heart was,” Larry said, staring at his wife Darlene’s picture.
  “I can’t imagine a world without her. She was my life. What am I supposed to do now? How am I going to go on living?”
  When a spouse dies, our lives change instantly. Everything is impacted. Life as we’ve known it is over.
  You’re feeling the pain of this great loss and its incredible impact. Like a tsunami, it sweeps over everything. Grief carries you along in its wake. Life becomes about survival.
  You don’t know what life will be like now. It’s hard, if not impossible, to contemplate. You can’t see around this bend in the road. But as you live one-day-at-a-time, the path ahead will become visible.
  For now, focus on the next step.
  “I can’t imagine life without you, but somehow I’ll find a way to live with even greater meaning and purpose.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn8ndwgewk9xderbzqvzq85z))
- Healthy grieving needs to take precedence over another relationship. You need to recover and heal in order to re-engage well. Otherwise, the new relationship will be more about your grief and your desire for things to be different than about you and the other person.
  “I’m more vulnerable than I know. I’ll take my time and heal.”

  Wanting another relationship like the one you lost is natural.
  Trying to replace what you lost while grieving can be dangerous.
  Listen to those you trust.
  Consult with people who know grief.
  Take your time.
  Focus on healing.
  You want a new relationship to be about the two people involved, not about alleviating your pain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn8mwswn0nz6mn5na1e16kg7))
