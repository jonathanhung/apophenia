- Whereas Smith is concerned with external provision, Barcott builds up internal strengths. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=139))
- But it doesn’t matter whether they can browse engineering jobs on their phones. Online opportunity isn’t always actual opportunity. Of course, Smith herself wouldn’t argue that a tenth-grade dropout from East Palo Alto and a Stanford computer science PhD have the same ability to hack software. Nevertheless, by equating the Internet with opportunity for underprivileged people, she has made a dubious assumption – an assumption that the Internet can make up for severe non-Internet deficiencies. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=143))
- I wanted to do more than serve the world’s gadget lovers. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=186))
- 2004. I hired a team of designers, engineers, and social scientists. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=240))
- We began projects in education, agriculture, health care, governance, microfinance, and so on. For education, we started by spending time in rural India’s government schools. They were blighted by absent teachers, broken toilets, and unquestioning parents. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=241))
- We declared victory, and temporarily forgot about the lack of toilets, the silent parents, and the absent teachers. Projects such as MultiPoint won us awards and recognition. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=255))
- In the course of five years, I oversaw at least ten different technology-for-education projects. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=288))
- While PCs can supplement good instruction, they don’t substitute for time with real teachers. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=325))
- there’s a big difference between learning the digital tools of modern life (easy to pick up and getting easier by the day, thanks to improving technology) and learning the critical thinking skills necessary for an information age (hard to learn and therefore demanding good adult guidance). ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=424))
- All of the content I tutored is available on math websites and in free Khan Academy videos, and every student had round-the-clock Internet access. But even with all that technology, and even at a school with a luxurious 9:1 student-teacher ratio, what their parents wanted for their kids was extra adult guidance. If this is the case for Lakeside students with their many life advantages, imagine how much more it must be the case for the world’s less privileged children. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=437))
- students have twelve years to reconstruct the world’s profoundest thoughts – discoveries that history’s greatest thinkers took centuries to hit upon. This is not casual play, and it requires directed motivation. It doesn’t matter what flashy interactive graphics exist to teach this material unless a child does the hard internal work to digest it. To persevere, children need guidance and encouragement for all the hours of a school day, at least nine months of the year, sustained over twelve years. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=444))
- “it is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.” ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=474))
- By the third or fourth session, though, we hit a wall in what they could learn. Everyone was able to type her name in English as well as in Kannada, but the girls weren’t interested in writing anything beyond that. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=503))
- With just one class per week – their parents didn’t allow more – we couldn’t have taught them more employable skills such as programming or data entry. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=514))
- I realize that the class foreshadowed what I’d soon find in my own research: the initial optimism that surrounds technology, the doubt as reality hits, the complexity of outcomes, and the unavoidable role of social forces. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=530))
- So at the University of California, Berkeley, I met with dozens of professors who had studied different aspects of technology and society. I spent hours tracking down dusty, bound volumes in the stacks of libraries across campus. And here is what I learned. Theorists, despite many fine shades of distinction, fall roughly into four camps: technological utopians, technological skeptics, contextualists, and social determinists. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=538))
- Harvard professor Sheila Jasanoff has voiced the concerns of many in calling out climate change as a by-product of fossil-fuel-driven technologies. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=595))
- As I looked for some structure to our findings, three factors emerged as necessary for real impact. The first is the dedication of the researcher, not to research outcomes but to concrete social impact. ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=627))
- The second factor is the commitment and capacity of the partner organization. In my research group, we looked for capable, well-intentioned partners who had rapport with the communities we wanted to work with. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=636))
- The third factor lies with intended beneficiaries. They must have the desire and the ability to take advantage of the technology provided. ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=643))
- they were like any of us who fail to exercise and eat well despite knowing that we should. It didn’t matter whether we delivered the information via text messages, automated voice calls, entertaining videos, or interactive apps. Technology by itself didn’t budge social and psychological inertia. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=648))
- Social determinism rests on the plain fact that it is people who act and make decisions – technologies do not. ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=658))
- In other words, what people get out of technology depends on what they can do and want to do even without technology. ([Location 697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=697))
- If a private company is failing to make a profit, no one expects that state-of-the-art data centers, better productivity software, and new laptops for all of the employees will turn things around. Yet, that is exactly the logic of so many attempts to fix schools with technology. ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=733))
- He argued that Twitter was less an effective tool of protest and more a way for the outside world to eavesdrop on the events. ([Location 826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=826))
- “knowledge gap hypothesis,” in which the authors reported that public-service messaging delivered through mass media was better absorbed by wealthier, more educated households.52 ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=851))
- Throughout, it’s people taking action. The device is inanimate. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=889))
    - Note: users nd their behaviors have explanatory power, not decices [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- So it’s not that technology prevents true connection. The problem is that technology also makes it easy to have thin, empty interactions. In the choice between a challenging intimacy and casual fun, some of us choose the latter. One reason why some people can’t stop fiddling with their phones is something called FOMO – “the fear of missing out.”7 The fear of missing out on a better party, a better evening, a better life. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=910))
- There’s also ATUS, addiction to useless stimulation; PORM, pleasure of receiving messages; SWAP, seeing work as priority; UTSI, the urge to seem important; and any number of other latent emotional tics that are exacerbated by the technology. ([Location 919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=919))
- Not only had he saved the company money by avoiding an expensive digital solution, but he had identified the true problem. “I’m an IT guy,” he said, “but some of my best friends have training in anthropology. They are good at seeing the human issues behind technology.” ([Location 990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=990))
- What is actually happening was predicted by MIT professors Marshall Van Alstyne and Erik Brynjolfsson as early as 1996 – two years before Google and eight years before Facebook. “Internet users,” they wrote, “can seek out interactions with like-minded individuals who have similar values” while minimizing interactions with those whose values differ. ([Location 1024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1024))
- In general, technology results in positive outcomes only where positive, capable human forces are already in place. ([Location 1162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1162))
- Who forms the critical human substrate? In my team’s educational technology projects, we saw that the key people were the researchers who developed the technology, the teachers who applied the technology, and the students who used the technology. These three groups have analogues in other contexts as leaders, implementers, and beneficiaries. ([Location 1367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1367))
- These three groups have analogues in other contexts as leaders, implementers, and beneficiaries. Leaders are those who have power over a packaged intervention – what form it takes, whether it is applied, and how. ([Location 1369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1369))
- When it works, microcredit is a marvel of implementation that combines a high-precision process with compassion for borrowers. ([Location 1388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1388))
- leaders and implementers often overestimate the desire and capability of beneficiaries. Yunus, for example, says of poor households, “All they need is financial capital.”31 Perhaps out of respect, he dismisses any need to train them: “The fact that the poor are alive is clear proof of their ability. They do not need us to teach them how to survive.” ([Location 1397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1397))
- just like with anyone else, motivation and ability can’t be taken for granted; they often need to be built up. Everyone wants to live a long life, but couch potatoes struggle to keep up exercise regimens. Most people value education, but few can sustain hours of directed study day after day, year after year, on their own. Everybody wants freedom, but not everyone will risk their own lives on the frontline of protest. Even vaccines, which more or less work upon injection, have no effect if potential beneficiaries don’t want them. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1406))
- When I met Yunus, he spoke of the Herculean efforts required to grow Grameen Bank: nurturing capable borrowers into employees, finding new ways for women to earn income, spurring house-bound wives to enter public life, and on and on. It was clear he had climbed mountains beyond mountains, all the while holding the hands of his borrowers and pulling them along. Even as he denies that poor people need training, he describes a unique culture at Grameen Bank that all of his borrowers join. At each meeting, for example, they recite “Sixteen Decisions,” ranging from, “We shall build and use pit latrines,” to, “If anyone is in difficulty, we shall all help him or her.”46 Yunus may not think of this as training, but it’s definitely a lot more than just credit. ([Location 1474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1474))
- Of course, technologies can enrich lives; voting can empower citizens; and microcredit can lead to better livelihoods. But “can” is not always “will.” ([Location 1504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1504))
- Maybe there were other approaches to social change. So I engaged with three ideas that have growing support – randomized controlled trials, social enterprises, and happiness as a goal. These are largely unrelated efforts, but they all have great merit and are well-regarded within their specializations. ([Location 1560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1560))
- The research team was led by Esther Duflo, a brilliant MIT economist who counts among her honors a MacArthur “genius grant” as well as the John Bates Clark Medal, a good predictor of future Nobel laureates. ([Location 1576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1576))
- Maybe the results weren’t caused by the camera program alone, but by the camera program as implemented by a strong organization committed to quality education.12 Conversations with the staff confirmed my hunch. ([Location 1610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1610))
- To guarantee these requirements, researchers prefer to run RCTs in partnership with capable organizations such as Seva Mandir – that is, organizations capable of following onerous instructions. But by working with competent implementers, the experiments necessarily occur in special conditions that aren’t common elsewhere. ([Location 1635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1635))
- You can hear reverberations of Rossi’s Iron Law of Evaluation. There is, he wrote, a world of difference “between running a program on a small scale with highly skilled and very devoted personnel and running a program with the lesser skilled and less devoted personnel.” ([Location 1642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1642))
- So none of the nine cases Prahalad held out as paragons of “eradicating poverty with profits” were any such thing. ([Location 1687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1687))
- Karnani more sensibly argued that the best way to support poor people was to help them become higher-income producers, not consumers. ([Location 1693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1693))
- Imagine if you made a $50 donation to a nonprofit, and out of that, say, $10 went to the cause while $10 came back to you as a thank-you gift and $30 facilitated the executive director’s multimillion-dollar bonus. You wouldn’t stand for it. Yet this is effectively the Toms “business model.” ([Location 1723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1723))
- But Toms does one more thing: By misleadingly presenting itself as primarily interested in charity, the company diverts the goodwill of people who might otherwise engage more deeply in a cause. In what psychologists call moral self-licensing, people use past good deeds – even minor ones – to excuse future apathy.34 So there’s a good chance that many Toms customers skimp on more worthwhile efforts, something they probably wouldn’t do if they bought their shoes from Nike, which runs its own social responsibility initiative but with less self-congratulatory fanfare. ([Location 1734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1734))
- All of this adds to an ongoing case made by scholars, policymakers, and activists who argue that today’s dominant metrics of national progress are deficient. ([Location 1777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1777))
- There’s a danger, though, of worshipping the measurable at the expense of other key qualities. ([Location 1839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1839))
- It’s foolish to neglect metrics where they’re available – but to think that only what’s measurable is meaningful is pure sophistry. ([Location 1853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=1853))
- In the face of these problems, supporters proposed further technological fixes. If telecenter operators lacked skills, they would design online communities to share best practices. If rural patients wanted to see real physicians, video teleconferencing was the answer. If there were barriers of language and literacy, they called for more user-friendly content tailored for local needs, translated into local languages and shot as videos that didn’t require reading. And on and on. ([Location 2015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=2015))
- For the next six months, I barely saw Gandhi. Most weeks, he stayed in the villages. He worked alongside Green Foundation staff and got to know farmers in the area. Every once in a while, he’d pop into the office, and we’d talk about what he had been up to and what he could do next. One week, he told me, “I think I now understand Green Foundation’s agriculture programs, so I’m moving on to capturing their advice on video.” ([Location 2040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=2040))
- The Three Habits of Highly Effective Technology Use ([Location 2071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=2071))
- Rule 1 – Identify or build human forces that are aligned with your goals. ([Location 2073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=2073))
- Though Gandhi has absorbed a lot of agricultural knowledge over the years, he is by no means an expert. Nor are most of us on the board or among Digital Green’s senior leadership. Our strengths are in nonprofit management, technology, and international development. ([Location 2106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=2106))
- I’ve found that three qualities make a good partner: good intention, discernment, and self-control, or what I’ve come to think of as heart, mind, and will. ([Location 2127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=2127))
- it’s increasingly clear that stabilizing or reversing climate change will require mass intrinsic growth. As individuals, we need the intention to leave a sustainable world for our descendants, the discernment to recognize the urgency of the situation, and the self-control to curb consumption. Our corporations need intention, discernment, and self-control to place long-term value above short-term profit. And our political leaders need the same intention and discernment, as well as the self-control to resist special interests and careerism. ([Location 2518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=2518))
- As a result, meaningful expenditures on education or capacity building are often seen as unsustainable, because they incur high costs and require someone to keep paying for them year after year. (Here again is C. K. Prahalad, who, as you may remember, groaned that “charity might feel good, but it rarely solves the problem in a scalable and sustainable fashion.”) ([Location 2754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=2754))
- Ashesi also provides a hint toward large-scale impact. University president Awuah argues that if today’s African college graduates – just 5 percent of every age group – could be persuaded to work toward Africa’s future, the continent would be transformed in twenty years when that 5 percent would inevitably assume leadership. ([Location 2800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=2800))
- taking a nation from a dollar-a-day income to $11,670 a year per capita, the US poverty level for a single-person household, would require about four decades at a sustained breakneck growth rate of 10 percent a year.56 In comparison, it only takes twenty years to raise a new generation. Speed is relative. China and the East Asian tigers pulled themselves up in a matter of decades, thanks in great part to widespread investments in high-quality universal education. ([Location 2807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=2807))
- In the years before she quit, Agyare wanted to ensure a secure livelihood. She had positive intention for her future self. She had a solid base of knowledge and the discernment to land good jobs. She had the self-control to see her goals through. In a nutshell, she had enough heart, mind, and will to secure personal well-being and success. ([Location 2870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=2870))
- First, none of the transitions were about earning more money. They were about family, autonomy, recognition, intellectual reward, and social impact. Money was still important – few took on work without pay, and many of them could afford to change jobs because they had a fluffy financial cushion. But the desire for wealth was satiated at some point, and other desires took over. ([Location 2899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=2899))
- No one in the US government, the World Bank, or the Gates Foundation is asking, “How do we encourage people through transformational internal epiphanies?” Partly, the problem is that today’s metric-focused technocrats all but laugh at what seem like soft intangibles. Partly, the problem is that policy is disconnected from fields that consider these changes of heart. Partly, it’s that the fields that once used to think about deep questions like this have stopped asking them. ([Location 2993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=2993))
- The alternative is to ask, What makes a person intrinsically motivated for the larger social good? What makes a Patrick Awuah or a Regina Agyare? Today’s number-crunching disciplines have no answer to such questions. But developmental psychology does. Psychologists going back to Sigmund Freud have sought to explain human maturation as a staged process of personality, ([Location 3002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=3002))
- Less understood is Maslow’s claim that people are “multimotivated” and that behavior is “multidetermined.” People have multiple needs at once, even if one might dominate. At any time, each of a person’s needs might be satisfied to different degrees: “It is as if the average citizen is satisfied perhaps 85 percent in physiological needs, 70 percent in safety needs, 50 percent in love needs, 40 percent in self-esteem needs, and 10 percent in self-actualization needs.”23 And any single behavior might be motivated by multiple needs. We work hard at our jobs because pay and benefits satisfy physiological needs, security needs, and esteem needs; the recognition for our work satisfies esteem needs; and, if the work is deeply interesting to us, it is an expression of self-actualization. ([Location 3045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=3045))
- So Maslow’s hierarchy is actually two hierarchies. One – about the influence of external conditions on behavior – explains why most of us would prefer to go three days without self-actualizing work than three days without water. That’s the hierarchy of needs as it’s popularly understood. The other hierarchy – about intrinsic motivation – explains what allows some people to sacrifice lower needs for the sake of higher ones. A hunger striker puts self-transcendent goals ahead of survival needs. That shows a kind of maturity, an ability to suppress or ignore more urgent needs in the service of a larger aspiration. To distinguish this internal gradient from the external hierarchy of needs, I’ll refer to it as the hierarchy of aspirations. ([Location 3073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=3073))
- Few think about causing long-term changes in society through growth in individual character.43 ([Location 3152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=3152))
- Intrinsic growth stresses internal maturation over external change. It accepts that real progress is slow and gradual. And it links progress to the flourishing of certain universal values – not only of personal freedoms, but of personal goodness. A framework of human development provides a counter to the Tech Commandments. Real progress isn’t strictly about satisfying our every present desire. It’s about our desires themselves evolving. ([Location 3180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=3180))
- Narasimha is part of a national shift in India. He represents a new stratum of Indian society that is rapidly climbing out of poverty. It’s driven in part by the country’s growing wealth and in part by a wave of mass intrinsic growth. Although Narasimha grew up in a poor rural family, the combination of basic education, self-motivation, and economic opportunity puts him in a new category. He’s somewhere between the vast population of the extreme poor who haven’t yet seen much change and the historical upper classes. ([Location 3248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=3248))
- •  Much of the variation in human values between societies boils down to two broad dimensions: a first dimension of “traditional vs. secular-rational values” and a second dimension of “survival vs. self-expression values.” ([Location 3327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=3327))
- “As individual safety and autonomy reduce egocentrism, they increase homocentrism” – the concern for all humankind that Maslow saw in self-actualizing and self-transcendent people.24 ([Location 3359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=3359))
- The real secret, evident all around me in my Bangalore office, was India’s decades-long cultivation of its brightest engineers through institutions such as the IITs. ([Location 3387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=3387))
- Where can we locate the true origins of the large-scale change that started with the Indian technology sector? Though it was undoubtedly enabled by foreign direct investment, high-caliber engineering education and internationally experienced managers were absolute preconditions. A single change in law wasn’t enough. We can see this because we know that foreign ([Location 3416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=3416))
- The rise of the creative class is an international phenomenon led by developed-world cities. Florida estimated that in the United States the creative class grew from 3 million to 38 million people between 1900 and 2000, or from 10 percent to 30 percent of the working population. ([Location 3441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=3441))
- Among the creative class, self-actualization is a prominent theme. Florida wrote, “Creative workers do not merely move up the scale in Abraham Maslow’s classic hierarchy of needs. Most are not very worried about meeting the basic needs of subsistence; they’re already on the upper rungs of the ladder, where intrinsic rewards such as esteem and self-actualization are sought.” ([Location 3446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TT1VSA2&location=3446))
- So which comes first – individual intrinsic growth, or societal intrinsic development?37 The likely answer is that they cause each other. Individual growth tends to lead to national growth and vice versa. Socioeconomic growth and Maslovian development, like many strongly correlated social phenomena, are mutually reinforcing, at least up to a certain point of wealth. As people become richer, they aspire toward something more than mere survival. And as more people aspire to something beyond survival, society makes itself richer.
