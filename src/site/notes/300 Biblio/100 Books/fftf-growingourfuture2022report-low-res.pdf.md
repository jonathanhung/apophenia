- Value networks: A value network, as defined by American business consultant Verna Allee, is “any set of roles and interactions in which people engage in both tangible and intangible exchanges to achieve economic or social good”3 We use this in place of “supply chains or value chains” to describe a more holistic picture of value exchange and to recognize that many communities of color find the “supply chain” terminology harmful because of its associations with the history of slavery in the US.

While there is an incredible amount of energy around these programs, it remains to be seen whether they can provide adequate incentives to deliver positive environmental and social impacts. (Page 13)
- $2 billion in investment is a huge step to help “balance the efficiency with resiliency” according to Secretary Vilsack. This builds on USDA investments in rural infrastructure, including $167 million to improve access to high-speed broadband and $466 million to build climate resilience in tribal communities. (Page 13)
- positive outcomes Many efforts to transition to regenerative agriculture operate in the same silos as the status quo agriculture system - isolated by commodity or sector, not reflecting the diverse farm landscapes that will make up a regenerative future. Likewise, many existing initiatives address only one part of the problem (using either a soil health or a social justice lens) rather than designing for multiple (Page 14)

- Ecosystem Services Markets (ESM) in which producers can get paid for the quantified and verified benefits provided to society, such as soil carbon sequestration, biodiversity, reduced GHG emissions, improved water quality and reduced water usage. (Page 18)
