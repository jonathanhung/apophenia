## Highlights 
---
- In many ways this book can be called a manual for mystics and prophets as we enter the 21st century. It is deep in its ecumenism and employment of interfaith and inter-spirituality practices, drawing not only on the rich Buddhist spiritual practices but also on exercises from other traditions and from the authors’ imaginative experience in leading workshops in healing of despair all over the world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gky9brjxarb1xyzcdf2qzhqz))
- This book is a wisdom book because it operates from the perspective of cosmology and spirituality which are integral to wisdom traditions the world over. It does not settle for knowledge alone. In addition, because so many of its stories and teachings have come from or been tested by thousands of persons around the world in workshops of healing, that too assures the wisdom of the collective ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gky9tbdtfzs9vn7a1yytpw43))
- This work can be done alone and has reached into countless individual lives. It is most effectively done in groups, for its methods are interactive and their power synergistic. Workshops vary in length from one day to a full lunar cycle; but even in briefer time frames, such as in classrooms or churches, the practices can yield remarkable openings to the truth of our common condition. They can bring us into fresh relationship with our world, and not only arouse our passion to protect life, but also steady us in a mutual belonging more real than our fears and even our hopes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gky9y1er2fbqjzpxdfwtp7wv))
- It is crucial that we know this: *we can meet our needs without destroying our life-support system.* We have the scientific knowledge and the technical means to do that. We have the savvy and the resources to grow sufficient quantities of real, unaltered food. We know how to protect clean air and water. We can generate the energy we require through solar power, wind, tides, algae and fungi. We have birth control methods to slow the growth of, and eventually reduce, human population. We have the technical and social mechanisms to dismantle weapons, deflect wars and give everyone a voice in democratic self-governance. We can exercise our moral imagination to bring our lifestyles and consumption into harmony with the living systems of Earth. All we need is the collective will.

- [The Cost of Blocking Our Pain for the World](#rch2sec3)
  We may try to protect ourselves from feeling pain for the world, but that very effort costs us a great deal. We pay a high price in diminished awareness, understanding and authenticity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn8ngs51qzqw518kxgrn3x4a))
- [*Impeded Empathy*](#rch2sec3lev5)
  Eros nourishes our rootedness in the web of life, fostering empathy, that vital connection to those with whom we share this world. Without empathy, our natural capacity to sense and identify with the joy and suffering of others is crippled. Instead, we tend to project our repressed fears and anger onto other people. Carl Jung called this the projection of the Shadow. The 9-11 event made us afraid, and people in the US were given an enemy as an object for our fear: Muslim people of the world. This allowed us to feel justified in our military actions against Muslim countries and fosters fear of those in our midst. It is hard to feel empathy for those we fear and hate, precisely when empathy is most needed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn8nhzh4g7wf2tza4hgyh0j6))
