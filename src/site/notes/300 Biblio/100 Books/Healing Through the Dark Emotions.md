- the metaphor of “emotional alchemy,” a transmutational process in which something ordinary, hard, and dull—a lump of lead—becomes something extraordinary, valuable, and beautiful—a nugget of gold—struck me as an apt description of the transmutation from grief to gratitude, fear to joy, and despair to faith that this book explores.

- Without a listener, the healing process is aborted. Human beings, like plants that bend toward the sunlight, bend toward others in an innate healing tropism. There are times when being truly listened to is more critical than being fed. Listening well to another’s pain is a primary form of nurturance, capable of healing even the most devastating of human afflictions, including the wounds and scars of violence, even the horrors of war and large-scale social trauma. Children speak their pain automatically when there is a listener, but learn to hide it when there is no ear to hear.

- From this work, I’ve seen again and again that the essence of healing emotional pain lies in listening to what hurts—in both knowing how to listen to oneself and being listened to by another. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007V3FKU4&location=476))
- Ignoring, stopping, and shaming or punishing emotion are the three parenting styles that most often result in emotional illiteracy in children. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007V3FKU4&location=563))
