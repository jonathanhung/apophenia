- Seeking Approval
  Because Nice Guys do not believe they are OK just as they are, they find a multitude of ways to convince themselves and others that they are lovable and desirable. They may focus on something about themselves (physical appearance, talent, intellect), something they do (act nice, dance well, work hard), or even something external to themselves (attractive wife, cute child, nice car) in order to get value and win other's approval.

- Nice Guys generally focus their attention on meeting everyone else's needs while trying to be "low maintenance" kinds of guys themselves. When I talk with them about making their needs a priority, their response is similar to that of Lars. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpvqv5p2y0zk2webpj6b972))
- Typically Nice Guys respond to these inaccurate interpretations of their life events by developing a number of survival mechanisms.
  • Trying to appear needless and wantless.
  • Making it difficult for others to give to them.
  • Using "covert contracts."
  • Caretaking — focusing attention on other people's needs.
  While creating an illusion of security in childhood, these survival mechanisms only increased the odds of their needs going unrecognized and unmet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpvrahprhj67rey2n3j6jjn))
- Though most Nice Guys have a difficult time grasping this concept, they are terrified of getting what they really want and will go to extreme measures to make sure they don't. Nice Guys carry out this unconscious agenda by connecting with needy or unavailable people, operating from an unspoken agenda, being unclear and indirect, pushing people away, and sabotaging. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpvsg40v8c7yt4tqsfd0fpp))
- Nice Guys believe their caretaking is fundamentally loving and is one of the things that makes them good people. In reality, caretaking has nothing to do with being loving or good. Caretaking is an immature and indirect attempt to try to get one's needs met.
  Caretaking always consists of two parts:
  1) Focusing on another's problems, needs, or feelings in order to
  2 ) Feel valuable, get one's own needs met, or to avoid dealing with one's own problems or feelings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpvvapmdxc4afevedsgcafq))
- Within a period of a year, Reese entered into three intense relationships. Each began wonderfully and seemed like the partnership he had been looking for. Each failed because of the same scenario: Reese picked men who needed rescuing or fixing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpvw08nb5vsv2s55wxs0hrt))
- Caretaking
  1 ) Gives to others what the giver needs to give.
  2) Comes from a place of emptiness within the giver.
  3 ) Always has unconscious
  strings attached.
  Caring
  1 ) Gives to others what the receiver needs.
  2) Comes from a place of abundance within the giver.
  3 ) Has no strings attached. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpvwdyqqvn1ecqfkt3fkpat))
- 1) The Nice Guy gives to others hoping to get something in return.
  2) When it doesn't seem that he is getting as much as he gives or he isn't getting what he expected, he feels frustrated and resentful.
  Remember, the Nice Guy is the one keeping score and he isn't totally objective.
  3) When this frustration and resentment builds up long enough, it spills out in the form of rage attacks, passive-aggressive behavior, pouting, tantrums, withdrawing, shaming, criticizing, blaming, even physical abuse. Once the cycle has been completed, it usually just begins all over again. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpvy24h1x2x1zqn5v02kjne))
- In order for Nice Guys to get their needs met, they must begin to shift their core paradigms. This shift includes coming to believe:
  • Having needs is part of being human.
  • Mature people make meeting their own needs a priority.
  • They can ask for help in meeting their needs in clear and direct ways.
  • Other people really do want to help them meet their needs.
  • This world is a place of abundance ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpw0ens434qzbnczjpzjkkm))
- Shane's plan for putting himself first involved paying attention to when he had an impulse to do something for his girlfriend. Whenever he felt this impulse, he would instead do something for himself. When he thought about washing her car, he washed his own instead. When he felt the urge to buy her a gift, he bought himself something instead. When he thought about calling her just to see if she was OK, he called a group member instead. All of this created tremendous anxiety for Shane.
  Much to his surprise, at the end of the week Racquel reported she felt a lot less smothered by Shane and actually looked forward to spending time with him. She even called late one evening after the kids were in bed and invited him over to make love.
  A couple of weeks later, Shane and Racquel talked about the change in a couples counseling session. They decided to continue the process. For a period of six months they agreed that Shane would not give any gifts or plan any surprises for Racquel. During the following six months he refrained from giving her birthday, Christmas, and Valentine's cards or gifts. During this time he focused on taking better care of himself and getting his needs met.
  In time Shane came to see that not only did Racquel not stop loving him, she actually became more giving to Shane. One year later, they both reported that Shane could give a gift without using it as a way to get approval or affirmation. During this time, Shane had also learned that making his needs a priority made him less dependent, needy, and fearful. Both Shane and Racquel reported enjoying all the changes they had experienced since Shane made the decision to start putting himself first.

- In attempt to cope with the uncertainty of their chaotic childhood, Nice Guys developed a belief system that if they could just do everything right, then everything would go right in their lives. Sometimes these men also developed belief systems that their childhood was ideal and problem-free (the opposite of reality) in order to cope with their abandonment experiences. These were all distorted beliefs, but these illusions helped these helpless little boys deal with the turmoil that was out of their control.
  A second reason Nice Guys never accomplish their goal of having a smooth life is that they do the opposite of what works. By approaching adult situations with survival mechanisms that were formed when they were naive and powerless, they are insured of having very little success in creating anything that resembles stability in their lives.

- There is a solution to the helplessness and vulnerability Nice Guys feel. Recovery from the Nice Guy Syndrome allows Nice Guys to embrace the personal power that is their birthright. Reclaiming personal power includes:
  • Surrendering.
  • Dwelling in reality.
  • Expressing feelings.
  • Facing fears.
  • Developing integrity.
  • Setting boundaries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpwvxg01zra1hckfpnaw6k5))
- Dwelling In Reality Helps Nice Guys Reclaim Their Personal Power
  Nice Guys try to control their world by creating belief systems about people and situations that are not based in reality. They then act as if these beliefs are accurate. This is why their behavior often seems illogical to outside observers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpwwmg9hg4mjq7fz6kxhd95))
- Expressing Feelings Helps Nice Guys Reclaim Their Personal Power
  Nice Guys are terrified of two kinds of feelings — their own and everyone else's. Any kind of intensity causes Nice Guys to feel out of control. As children, feeling things intensely invited either negative attention or no attention at all. Therefore, it came to feel safer to clamp a lid down tightly on any emotion that might attract too much negative attention or might cause them to feel abandoned.
  I remember early in our marriage when Elizabeth would express her frustration over my inability to share what I was feeling. Like most Nice Guys, I had come to see feelings as a dangerous thing. After 30 plus years of conditioning, I had no clue what Elizabeth wanted from me.
  Even as I began to become aware of my feelings, I often kept them to myself. It is almost comical how infrequently it crosses a Nice Guy's mind to tell his partner what he is feeling ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpwyw5ygybjs5f4aewgc3dm))
- I frequently hear Nice Guys rationalize the withholding of their feelings by claiming they don't want to hurt anyone. The truth is they are covering their own butts. What they are really saying is that they don't want to do anything that might recreate their childhood experiences. They're really not trying to protect anyone from harm, they're just trying to keep their world smooth and under control.
  I frequently tell Nice Guys, "Your feelings are just feelings, they won't kill you." Regardless of whether a Nice Guy is feeling anxious, helpless, shameful, lonely, rageful, or sad, his feelings aren't life-threatening.
  The goal of teaching Nice Guys to embrace their feelings is not to make them soft and "touchy-feely." Men who are in touch with their feelings are powerful, assertive, and energized. Contrary to what many Nice Guys believe, they don't have to become more like women in order to have their feelings. This is why I support men in learning about their feelings from other men. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpwzjwnkmqgzm8nbgnk3x1a))
- Some guidelines about expressing feelings.
  • Don't focus on the other person, "You are making me mad."
  Instead, take responsibility for what you are feeling: "I am feeling angry."
  • Don't use feeling words to describe what you are thinking, as in "I feel like Joe was trying to take advantage of me."
  Instead, pay attention to what you are experiencing in your body: "I'm feeling helpless and frightened."
  • In general, try to begin feeling statements with "I", rather than "you."
  Try to avoid the crutch of saying "I feel like." As in "I feel like you are being mean to me." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpx1f1qtv0ad05n2r0c0x5y))
- Developing Integrity Helps Nice Guys Reclaim Their Personal Power
  Most Nice Guys pride themselves on being honest and trustworthy. In reality, Nice Guys are fundamentally dishonest. They have the ability to tell a lie or withhold the truth and still believe the illusion that they are basically honest people. Since dishonesty is a fear-based behavior, telling lies and withholding the truth robs Nice Guys of their personal power.
  I define lying as anything less than the truth. This may seem evident to most people, but it is important to define "lying," and "telling the truth," because Nice Guys are adept at creating definitions that justify their behavior.

- Toxic Shame Prevents Nice Guys From Getting The Love They Want
  Intimacy implies vulnerability. I define intimacy as "knowing the self, being known by another, and knowing another." Intimacy requires two people who are willing to courageously look inward and make themselves totally visible to another. Internalized toxic shame makes this kind of exposure feel life-threatening for Nice Guys. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpw5mfbxtmjbrzy4rb4j7y9))
- Co-Creating Dysfunctional Relationships Prevents Nice Guys From Getting The Love They Want
  The Nice Guy's ongoing attempt to hide his perceived badness makes intimacy a challenge. The moment Nice Guys enter a relationship they begin a balancing act. In relationships, a life-and-death struggle is played out to balance their fear of vulnerability with their fear of isolation. Vulnerability means someone may get too close to them and see how bad they are. Nice Guys are convinced that when others make this discovery, these people will hurt them, shame them, or leave them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpw63q1g32hrgxf4628tz4g))
- Patterns Of Enmeshment And Avoidance Prevent Nice Guys From Getting The Love They Want
  This intimacy balancing act gets played out in two distinct ways for Nice Guys. The first is through becoming overly involved in an intimate relationship at the expense of one's self and other outside interests. The second is through being emotionally unavailable to a primary partner while playing the Nice Guy role outside of the relationship. I call the first type of Nice Guy an enmesher and the second type an avoider. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpw6nzm7ez1q9zaq8acmv4f))
- I sometimes refer to enmeshing Nice Guys as table dogs. They are like little dogs who hover beneath the table just in case a scrap happens to fall their way. Enmeshing Nice Guys do this same hovering routine around their partner just in case she happens to drop him a scrap of sexual interest, a scrap of her time, a scrap of a good mood, or a scrap of her attention. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpw7dfymg3n4m332m9wq8m9))
- By adapting the points below and changing the way in which they live their lives, recovering Nice Guys will change the way they have relationships. Nice Guys can:
  • Approve of themselves.
  • Put themselves first.
  • Reveal themselves to safe people.
  • Eliminate covert contracts.
  • Take responsibility for their own needs.
  • Surrender.
  • Dwell in reality.
  • Express their feelings.
  • Develop integrity.
  • Set boundaries.
  • Embrace their masculinity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpw8rwm0p1qdbzn7wxfxw95))
- The essence of recovery from the Nice Guy Syndrome is the conscious decision to live one's life just as one desires. I frequently encourage recovering Nice Guys to be just who they are, without reservation. I support them in deciding what is right for them and being that with all of their energy for the whole world to see. The people who like them just as they are will hang around. The people who don't, won't. This is the only way to have a healthy relationship. No one really wants to believe that they have to be false or hide who they really are to get someone to love them or stay with them. Yet, this is a common dynamic in the intimate relationships Nice Guys create. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpw9q3ve521fazsbetnj65e))
- Setting Boundaries Helps Nice Guys Get The Love They Want
  The subject of boundaries was presented in Chapter Five. Nowhere is the issue of boundary setting more important for Nice Guys than in their most intimate relationships. By setting healthy boundaries with their partners, Nice Guys create situations in which both they and their partner can feel safe to be vulnerable and experience true intimacy.
  I show Nice Guys, often with their partners watching, how to step up to their line and set boundaries. On more than one occasion, I have had the partner of a Nice Guy applaud during the demonstration. The Nice Guy will turn, slack-jawed, and say, "You mean you want me to stand up to you, dear?"
  "Of course I do," she will respond, "I don't want to be married to someone I can walk all over."
  Then I warn him. "Your wife is telling you the truth. She doesn't feel safe knowing she can push you around. She wants to know that you will stand up to her. That is how she will feel secure in the relationship. But, here's the catch. She has to test to see if she can trust you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpwbbdmq3x9gbdpgjbgpcdr))
- To help Nice Guys decide if they need to set a boundary with a particular behavior, I have them apply the Second Date Rule. Using the second date rule, Nice Guys ask themselves, "If this behavior had occurred on the second date, would there have been a third?" This question helps them see if they have been putting up with something that they shouldn't. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpwc5j1fsgza729011j53tc))
- When trying to decide how to deal with a behavior they have deemed unacceptable, I encourage Nice Guys to apply the Healthy Male Rule. Following this rule of thumb, they simply ask themselves, "How would a healthy male handle this situation?" For some reason, just asking this question connects them with their intuitive wisdom and helps them access the power they need to respond appropriately. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpwcn46kk6ddya1dnr0r56k))
- When Nice Guys enter a relationship, they frequently choose partners who look more dysfunctional than they do. This creates a dangerous illusion that one of them is sicker than the other. This is a distortion, because healthy people are not attracted to unhealthy people — and vice versa. I frequently tell couples that if you have one obviously wounded person in a relationship, you always have two. No exception.

- Breaking Free Activity #35
  The next time you find yourself feeling frustrated, resentful, or rageful at your partner, ask yourself these questions:
  "Why have I invited this person into my life?" "What do I need to learn from this situation?"
  "How would my view of this situation change if I saw it as a gift?" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpwf2ne136nstkqqpnecrac))
- Every time a Nice Guy responds to or pays attention to a behavior he would like to eliminate, he is actually reinforcing that very behavior. This reinforcement increases the likelihood that that behavior will occur again. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpwfz47zh77rv3j6pr8meks))
- The difficulty Nice Guys have with sex can be directly linked to two issues: shame and fear. All Nice Guys have shame and fear about being sexual and about being sexual beings. In my experience, this is probably the most difficult concept for Nice Guys to understand and accept about themselves. This is so important I will say it again: All Nice Guys have shame and fear about being sexual and about being sexual beings.
  • If you could peel back a Nice Guy's brain and find the part of the unconscious mind that controls sex, here is what you would find:
  • Memories of childhood experiences that made him feel like he was bad.
  • The pain of not getting his needs met in a timely, healthy manner.
  • The effects of growing up with sexually wounded parents.
  • The sexual distortions and illusions of a really screwed up society.
  • The absence of accurate sexual information when it was needed.
  • The sexual guilt and shame associated with centuries of religious influence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpwkjqd7t2m6m3jzp2927vk))
