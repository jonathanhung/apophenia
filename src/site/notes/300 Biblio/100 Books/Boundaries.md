- When confronted with their lack of boundaries, they raise good questions: Can I set limits and still be a loving person? What are legitimate boundaries? What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries? How do I answer someone who wants my time, love, energy, or money? Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries? How do boundaries relate to submission? Aren’t boundaries selfish? ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=227))
- This book presents a biblical view of boundaries: what they are, what they protect, how they are developed, how they are injured, how to repair them, and how to use ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=234))
- Those things should be his problem, but as it now stands, they are yours. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=253))
- In the physical world, boundaries are easy to see. Fences, signs, walls, moats with alligators, manicured lawns, or hedges are all physical boundaries. In their differing appearances, they give the same message:this is where my property begins. The owner of the property is legally responsible for what happens on his or her property. Non-owners are not responsible for the property. Physical boundaries mark a visible property line that someone holds the deed to. You can go to the county courthouse and find out exactly where those boundaries of responsibility are and whom to call if you have business there. In the spiritual world, boundaries are just as real, but often harder to see. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=267))
- Boundaries define us. They define what is me and what is not me. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=274))
- We have to deal with what is in our soul, and boundaries help us to define what that is. If we are not shown the parameters, or are taught wrong parameters, we are in for much pain. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=282))
- He defines and takes responsibility for his personality by telling us what he thinks, feels, plans, allows, will not allow, likes, and dislikes. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=326))
- People with poor boundaries struggle with saying no to the control, pressure, demands, and sometimes the real needs of others. They feel that if they say no to someone, they will endanger their relationship with that person, so they passively comply but inwardly resent. Sometimes a person is pressuring you to do something; other times the pressure comes from your own sense of what you “should” do. If you cannot say no to this external or internal pressure, you have lost control of your property and are not enjoying the fruit of “self-control.

- People subject to another person’s addictions, control, or abuse are finding that after years and years of “loving too much,” they can find the ability to create boundaries only through a support group. Their support system is giving them the strength to say no to abuse and control for the first time in their lives. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=387))
- Fear of being alone keeps many in hurtful patterns for years. They are afraid that if they set boundaries they will not have any love in their life. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=392))

- Making decisions based on others’ approval or on guilt breeds resentment, a product of our sinful nature. We have been so trained by others on what we “should” do that we think we are being loving when we do things out of compulsion.

- The other aspect of limits that is helpful when talking about boundaries is setting our own internal limits. We need to have spaces inside ourselves where we can have a feeling, an impulse, or a desire, without acting it out. We need self-control without repression.

- To feel safe in such an evil world, children need to have the power to say things like: “No.” “I disagree.” “I will not.” “I choose not to.” “Stop that.” “It hurts.” “It’s wrong.” “That’s bad.” “I don’t like it when you touch me there. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=579))
- This type of boundary conflict is called compliance. Compliant people have fuzzy and indistinct boundaries; they “melt” into the demands and needs of other people. They can’t stand alone, distinct from people who want something from them. Compliants, for example, pretend to like the same restaurants and movies their friends do “just to get along.” They minimize their differences with others so as not to rock the boat. Compliants are chameleons. After a while it’s hard to distinguish them from their environment. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=583))

- Whenever they need to protect themselves by saying no, the word catches in their throats. This happens for a number of different reasons: Fear of hurting the other person’s feelings Fear of abandonment and separateness A wish to be totally dependent on another Fear of someone else’s anger Fear of punishment Fear of being shamed Fear of being seen as bad or selfish Fear of being unspiritual Fear of one’s overstrict, critical conscience ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=590))
- Some people, like Marti, are both compliants and avoidants. In a recent session, Marti laughed ruefully at herself. “I’m beginning to see a pattern here. When someone needs four hours with me, I can’t say no. When I need someone for ten minutes, I can’t ask for it. Isn’t there a transistor in my head that I can replace?” Marti’s dilemma is shared by many adults. She says “yes” to the bad (compliant) and says “no” to the good (avoidant). Individuals who have both boundary conflicts not only cannot refuse evil, they are unable to receive the support they so readily offer to others. They are stuck in a cycle of feeling drained, but with nothing to replace the lost energy. Compliant avoidants suffer from what is called “reversed boundaries.” They have no boundaries where they need them, and they have boundaries where they shouldn’t have them.

- you can’t develop or set boundaries apart from supportive relationships with God and others. Don’t even try to start setting limits until you have entered into deep, abiding attachments with people who will love you no matter what.

- Our deepest need is to belong, to be in a relationship, to have a spiritual and emotional “home.” The very nature of God is to be in relationship: “God is love,” says 1 John 4:16. Love means relationship—the caring, committed connection of one individual to another. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=787))

- Let’s be honest. None of us enjoys being told no. It’s difficult to accept another person’s refusal to give support, to be intimate, or to forgive. Yet good relationships are built on the freedom to refuse and confront: “As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another” (Prov. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=943))
- The child translates that message something like this: When I’m good, I am loved. When I’m bad, I am cut off. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=955))
- The child can either pretend to not disagree and keep the relationship, or he can continue to separate and lose his most important relationship in the world. He will most likely keep quiet. ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=958))

- Overcontrol occurs when otherwise loving parents try to protect their children from making mistakes by having too-strict rules and limits. For example, they may keep their children from playing with other kids to protect them from being hurt or learning bad habits. They may be so concerned about their children catching a cold that they make them wear galoshes on cloudy days. The problem with overcontrol is this: while a major responsibility of good parents is certainly to control and protect, they must make room for their children to make mistakes. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=1002))
- 3. You have the power to search and ask God and others to reveal more and more about what is within your boundaries. ([Location 1148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=1148))
- One word comes up again and again when people describe their problems with boundaries: they. “But they won’t accept me if I say no.” “But they will get angry if I set limits.” “But they won’t speak to me for a week if I tell them how I really feel. ([Location 1167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=1167))

- We judge the boundary decisions of others, thinking that we know best how they “ought” to give, and usually that means “they ought to give to me the way I want them to!” But the Bible says whenever we judge, we will be judged (Matt. 7:1–2). When we judge others’ boundaries, ours will fall under the same judgment. If we condemn others’ boundaries, we expect them to condemn ours. This sets up a fear cycle inside that makes us afraid to set the boundaries that we need to set. As a result, we comply, then we resent, and the “love” that we have “given” goes sour.

- If we love and respect people who tell us no, they will love and respect our no. Freedom begets freedom. If we are walking in the Spirit, we give people the freedom to make their own choices. “Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom” (2 Cor. 3:17). If we are going to judge at all, it needs to be by the “perfect law that gives freedom” (James 1:25). Our real concern with others should not be “Are they doing what I would do or what I want them to do?” but “Are they really making a free choice?” When we accept others’ freedom, we don’t get angry, feel guilty, or withdraw our love when they set boundaries with us. When we accept others’ freedom, we feel better about our own. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=1183))

- As we spent more time together, Stan learned that a lot of his “doing” and sacrificing was not motivated by love but by fear. Stan had learned early in life that if he did not do what his mother wanted, she would withdraw love from him. As a result, Stan learned to give reluctantly. His motive for giving was not love, but fear of losing love. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=1200))

- 5. Guilt. Many people’s giving is motivated by guilt. They are trying to do enough good things to overcome the guilt inside and feel good about themselves. When they say no, they feel bad. So they keep trying to earn a sense of goodness. ([Location 1211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=1211))

- 6. Payback. Many people have received things with guilt messages attached. For example, their parents say things like, “I never had it as good as you.” “You should be ashamed at all you get.” They feel a burden to pay for all they have been given. 7. Approval. Many feel as if they are still children seeking parental approval. Therefore, when someone wants something from them, they need to give so that this symbolic parent will be “well pleased.

- Her mother was sad and disappointed, but she was not harmed. Sandy’s decision caused sadness, but her mother’s sadness should not cause Sandy to change her mind. A loving response to her mother’s hurt would be, “Oh, Mom, I’m sad that we won’t be together too. I’m looking forward to next summer’s visit. ([Location 1245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=1245))
- We need to evaluate the pain our confrontation causes other people. We need to see how this hurt is helpful to others and sometimes the best thing that we can do for them and the relationship. We need to evaluate the pain in a positive light. ([Location 1254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=1254))
- Many of us have known people who, after years of being passive and compliant, suddenly go ballistic, and we wonder what happened.

- While reactive victims are primarily known by their “against” stances, proactive people do not demand rights, they live them. Power is not something you demand or deserve, it is something you express. The ultimate expression of power is love; it is the ability not to express power, but to restrain it.

- Do not try to get to freedom without owning your reactive period and feelings. You do not need to act this out, but you do need to express the feelings. You need to practice and gain assertiveness. You need to get far enough away from abusive people to be able to fence your property against further invasion. And then you need to own the treasures you find in your soul.

- We have many boundary problems because of relational fears. We are beset by fears of guilt, not being liked, loss of love, loss of connection, loss of approval, receiving anger, being known, and so on. These are all failures in love, and God’s plan is that we learn how to love. These relational problems can only be solved in relationships, for that is the context of the problems themselves, and the context of spiritual existence. Because of these fears, we try to have secret boundaries. We withdraw passively and quietly, instead of communicating an honest no to someone we love.

- Look at the first two ways of giving: “reluctantly” and “under compulsion.” They both involve fear—either of a real person or a guilty conscience.

- We can do no less. We can’t manipulate people into swallowing our boundaries by sugarcoating them. Boundaries are a “litmus test” for the quality of our relationships. Those people in our lives who can respect our boundaries will love our wills, our opinions, our separateness. Those who can’t respect our boundaries are telling us that they don’t love our no. They only love our yes, our compliance. ([Location 1452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=1452))

- This is a crucial point. We all need more than God and a best friend. We need a group of supportive relationships. The reason is simple: having more than one person in our lives allows our friends to be human. To be busy. To be unavailable at times. To hurt and have problems of their own. To have time alone.

- The idea is that because we have received something, we owe something. The problem is the nonexistent debt.

- will.” You should have a realistic expectation of yourself based on who you really are, your own true self with your own particular giftedness. You can only do this with boundaries that stand up and say, “This is me, and that is not me.” Stand up against others’ expectations of you.

- In fact, many people are afraid to forgive because they equate that with letting down their boundaries one more time and giving the other person the power to hurt them again. ([Location 3460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=3460))

([Location 3675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2K9W&location=3675))
- Our inability to get angry is generally a sign that we are afraid of the separateness that comes with telling the truth. We fear that saying the truth about our unhappiness with someone will damage the relationship. But when we acknowledge that truth is always our friend, we often give ourselves permission to be angry.

- As boundary-injured individuals begin developing their own boundaries, however, a change occurs. They become attracted to people who can hear their no without being critical. Without getting hurt. Without personalizing it. Without running over their boundaries in a manipulative or controlling fashion. People who will simply say, “Okay—we’ll miss you. See you next time.
