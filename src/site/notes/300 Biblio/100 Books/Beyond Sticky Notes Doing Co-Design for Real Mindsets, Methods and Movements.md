- Co-design is an approach to designing with, not for, people. While co-design is helpful in many areas, it typically works best where people with lived experience, communities and professionals work together to improve something that they all care about.

- Here are four key principles for co-design:
  Share power
  When differences in power are unacknowledged and unaddressed, the people with the most power have the most influence over decisions, regardless of the quality of their knowledge or ideas. To change that, we must share power in research, decision-making, design, delivery and evaluation. Without this, there is no co-design.
  Prioritise relationships
  Co-design isn’t possible without relationships, social connection and trust among co-designers, funders and organisers of co-design. Trust paves the way for conversations where we confront the metaphorical elephant in the room (or a stampede of them, in some cases). You can’t buy trust; it can only be earned – the better the social connection, the better the process and outputs of co-design.
  Use participatory means
  Co-design provides many ways for people to take part and express themselves, for example, through visual, kinaesthetic and oral approaches, instead of relying solely on writing, slideshows and long reports. Participatory approaches aren’t about relaying information or giving presentations; they’re about facilitating self-discovery and moving people from participants to active partners.
  Build capability
  Many people require support and encouragement to adopt new ways of being and doing, learn from others, and have their voices heard. To support that, designers can move from ‘expert’ to coach. In co-design, everyone has something to teach and something to learn.
  You can use the principles to build a shared understanding of co-design in your team or organisation, as well as to assess how different tools and methods could be adapted to work within a co-design process. If you get stuck, ask yourself questions such as: Will this share power? Does it build capability? Are we prioritising relationships?

- Often, co-design enables people to see themselves and each other differently. Transformational co-design can involve professionals discovering that people with lived experience do not need ‘empowering’ or to change in any way, but rather they must be listened to.
  #Tip: It’s not co-design if there’s only ever a homogenous group of people (e.g. teachers without students) – that’s a workshop or an interagency meeting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8c6w9bx96enm84z1094fkv9))
- feedback mechanisms in organisations are so delayed (if they exist at all) that the messages that something isn’t working fail to make their way through the hum of operational, regulatory and financial priorities. What if the goal of our social care systems was to learn continuously from and with the people we support? How would that change things?
