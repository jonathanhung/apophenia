- What makes a team of one special is that you find yourself in situations where you not only see an opportunity for a more user-centered approach, but you also need to lead the charge, bringing others along with you. A team of one challenges the mighty forces of the status quo, inertia, and other people’s way of doing things. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DUITE5Q&location=256))

- Understanding and empathizing with the user’s perspective is a vital foundation for user experience design. People with this background know how to conduct studies or experiments to uncover what people really do and why. That can be harder than it seems. It’s very easy for the observer to unconsciously change the behavior of the observed. But sociologists and anthropologists have rigorous methods and techniques for getting at what people really do. They also have the ability to turn a dizzying array of observations and data points into broader themes and ultimately meaning. These themes and their significance become the foundation upon which user experience design decisions are made.

- You can assess what sort of environment you’re stepping into with a “Listening Tour” (Chapter 5, “Planning and Discovery Methods”). These “tours” involve one-on-one meetings with key people that quickly educate you as to their perspectives on the project, organizational norms, how they like to work, and how receptive they are to the idea of your involvement.

- If you find that your vantage point is restricting you from looking beyond one piece of the system or process, you are ultimately hampered in your ability to consider and design for user experiences that are fluid. You may need to find novel ways to gain access and visibility across departments, deal with conflicting priorities, and make the most of insufficient or unclear resources. Here are some ideas.

- In design work, there are usually two things that contribute to how long something takes: 1) how much time it takes you to make the thing, and 2) how much time it takes to communicate about, revise, and get buy-in on the thing. Ideally, you want to be able to bill for both. One of the biggest threats to scope creep (and your profitability) is when you have accurate estimates and agreements for the first part, but not for the second.
