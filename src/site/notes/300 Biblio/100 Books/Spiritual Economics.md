## Highlights

- The starting point in realizing prosperity is to accept responsibility for your own thoughts, thus taking charge of your life. You are not responsible for what is said in the Wall Street Journal or what comes out of Washington in the form of economic indicators, but you are very much responsible for what you think about these things. You cannot afford to let the so-called experts decide how you are going to think and feel. ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006O4RKBS&location=164))

- Talk only about the things you want to see live and grow. Keep your thoughts centered in the ideas of abundance, sufficiency, and well-being. And occasionally give yourself a consciousness booster by affirming something like: God is my instant, constant, and abundant source of supply.
