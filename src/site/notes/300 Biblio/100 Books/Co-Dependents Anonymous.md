- codependence is a most deeply-rooted, compulsive behavior, and that it is born out of our sometimes moderately, sometimes extremely dysfunctional family systems.
  We have each experienced in our own ways the painful trauma of the emptiness of our childhood and relationships throughout our lives. We attempted to use others—our mates, our friends, and even our children, as our sole source of identity, value, and well-being, and as a way of trying to restore within us the emotional losses from our childhoods. Our histories may include other powerful addictions, which at times we have used to cope with our codependence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn66stht66s016jg983nj5mz))
- “If he/she changed, everything would be all right.”
  > “I can’t control this pain, these people and what’s happening.”
  “It’s all my fault.”
  “I keep getting into the same bad relationships.”
  “I feel so empty and lost.”
  “Who am I?”
  “What’s wrong with me?”
  Our sadness and loss bring us here. We want change, and we want it now. We want to escape our misery. We want to feel good about ourselves and live abundant, fulfilling lives. We want happy, healthy relationships. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn66y5haed838fxj9w9ya232))

- In CoDA, there is understanding and acceptance, not judgment and advice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn676p21pxezy8yypc66drpe))
- Often in our frustration, we clearly see what everyone else is doing wrong, but we can’t recognize our own wrongdoing. Some of us come to a place of despair and think of nothing else but giving up. We isolate from our friends and families, many times rejecting their love. Some of us go to elaborate degrees to create the “all together” act in our homes, marriages, families, jobs, friendships, and social lives. Try as we might to do otherwise, we often experience devastating marriages, parenting and family relationships, friendships, and careers. Sometimes, even then, our denial continues.

- Even if you’ve given up on a Higher Power or wonder if such a being exists, you are welcome to the program of Co-Dependents Anonymous. This is not a religious program, but a spiritual one; it’s a program for finding peace within. Over time, most everyone who makes a conscious choice to work this spiritual program decides what their Higher Power should be.

- Codependence causes a dilemma to boil inside us. For many of us, our pain and despair are signs of a deep inner need. This need, hunger or desire gnaws at the core of our being. It could be a cry for unconditional love, respect, nurturing, acceptance, or joy. Many of us turn to other people, drugs, alcohol, or other addictions to fill this need to gain some sense of safety, self-worth, and well-being. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn67fvsgbbpnc2ynfrngxjv8))
- Our answers to the following questions can help us determine how we’ve looked to other people or addictions for our emotional well-being.
  > •Do I control others to relieve my fears?
  > •Do I let others control me for fear of their abuse or neglect?
  > •Do I adapt or change my behavior for others?
  > •Do I validate my value and worth as a person through them?
  > •Do I avoid others in order to feel safe? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gngaj2t0en7km545awgnb3vg))
- Many of us take pride in controlling circumstances and those around us. If we think we might be abandoned, abused, or neglected by others, we label them as the problem and manipulate them. Specifically, we may over control our mates, children, family members, friends, or associates by dominating them. Another way we control them is by being “nice,” passive or quiet for long periods of time. Then, when fear or other feelings overwhelm us, we rage, isolate, or allow others to act out our feelings for us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gngakb45jhsggx2fw8f0aq4q))
- Many of us seek false gods. We numb our feelings with alcohol, drugs, food, sex, or work; these often turn into chronic addictions and compound our problems. None of them provide us freedom or peace.
  Regardless of whether we position ourselves as “better than” or “less than,” as a controller or avoider, we behave in self-centered ways. Equality is lost. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gngax0r0bt2338xq4858rya8))
- For example, we may leave the premises of a person who is verbally or physically threatening us. We behave codependently, however, if we allow fear or shame to dictate our lives, causing us to rely on past survival instincts such as control and avoidance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gngawkwe9tn665k6sk4kzm0q))
- Over time (most often without our knowing), our abusers became our Higher Power. We learned to fear their authority. As the abuse and neglect continued, the possibility of developing an emotionally fulfilling relationship with ourselves, others, and our Higher Power diminished.
  We learned survival skills in order to cope. We controlled or avoided potentially volatile circumstances. We cast away our childhood, tried to become little adults, or rebelled. Many of us didn’t understand our actions because they were often instinctive.
  Over time, we learned how to alleviate our fear and shame by controlling and/or avoiding ourselves and others. When we felt overwhelmed or stressed out, we relied on what we knew best to survive. In this devastating codependent cycle, we took greater control of life, allowing less room for a power greater than ourselves to work through us.

- We hope to find peace and happiness and leave the past behind; but instead, we recreate similar or opposite circumstances in our adult relationships. Neither extreme is healthy. We unknowingly transfer the characteristics and power of our childhood abusers to significant people in our lives today. Sometimes we transfer abusive characteristics to our Higher Power, too.
  In our adult relationships, we fearfully guard against any sign of shame, abuse, or neglect. We become manipulative or avoid other people and circumstances. This fear can grow stronger than the shame itself. It forms a shaky foundation for relationships. We continue to draw others near us (hoping for intimacy) but when they get too close, we push them away because of our fear of shame.

- Step One
  We admitted we were powerless over others—that our lives had become unmanageable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr550g6yhf3aaztcchrexgzh))
- This Step helps us to identify our lifetime of experiences, feelings and behaviors, to pinpoint how we avoid, control and manipulate ourselves, other people and circumstances ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr551hdr7yfvp5aktqnz0nwa))
- We learn how we’ve become our own Higher Power or placed others in that role ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr551w43qfsd2g4w42c6vzam))
- We begin to see that God has not given us the right to control another person’s behavior, but we have been given the responsibility to set limits and boundaries for ourselves with others ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr5523ahxv4h83f3h2tmjs8h))
