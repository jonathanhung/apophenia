## Highlights 
---
- To open our minds wide enough to embrace both sides of a polarity is a creative act. ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BZXK2CD&location=395))
- How might we avoid being one of these types? How do we create what we dream of and bring our ideas into the shared material world? We must learn to harness the energy of both vision and embodiment, by living in the balance point between the two. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BZXK2CD&location=400))
- When we can transform intense emotions in a difficult conversation, by feeling them fully and stating them with calm acceptance, we increase our capacity for emotional resilience. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BZXK2CD&location=418))
- This ability to delay the gratification of immediate expression, in favor of the long-term gratification of effective action, is one important aspect of emotional intelligence (a phrase coined by the science journalist Daniel Goleman).5 We will talk much more about the importance of emotional intelligence and resilience, and how to develop them, in Part II and III of this book.

- When we don’t pause, or lack this trust in the guidance of our bodies, we can easily fill our lives up with “shoulds” and obligations. Answering others with, Let me check, and tuning in our sensations, is not only a form of honoring our own needs. It’s also a practice of embodiment, and a means of sharpening our self-understanding. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BZXK2CD&location=450))
- This is a markedly different experience from gossip or complaining. We do not vent to put others down, or to raise ourselves up. In conscious venting, we are choosing to welcome the energy of our emotions, so that we can ultimately come to a place of more dignity and more humility. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BZXK2CD&location=547))
- When we express our emotions with conscious intent (rather than suppress or repress them), we become their director, rather than their puppet. And when we purposely bring others into the process with consent, we allow them into our vulnerability—instead of sucking them into our stories and dramas. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BZXK2CD&location=549))
- These imperatives in our nervous system also process social tension as a kind of survival threat. In fact, current neuroscience research shows that our brains give us emotional pain signals when we deviate from group norms or detect disapproval from others.
