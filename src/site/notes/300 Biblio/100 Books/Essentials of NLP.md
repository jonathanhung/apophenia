- Subliminals can also do something called priming. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=154))
- Subliminals exert their influence with a few words, a very simple idea, or just an image. ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=159))
- In NLP, we use anchors to get into the right state of mind for doing something. In order to have an anchor, you have to connect a symbol with a desired state of mind. You can create an especially powerful symbol by using a point on your body that you touch, or a way that you position your fingers. If, every time you feel confident, you make an okay sign with your non-dominant hand, you can help generate confidence by making that okay sign. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=174))
- NLP practitioners observe that they can improve their connection with others and create more effective excellence strategies by paying attention to which sense modes a person uses. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=194))
- States tend to make certain abilities more accessible. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=198))
- The word “parts” refers to clusters of values, motivations, and other personality traits that tend to work together, a little bit like a personality. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=209))
- How to I create a WellFormed Outcome? ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=255))
- To answer the question “What do I want?”, keep working on your answer until you have stated it in 100% positive terms. This really helps build your motivation. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=266))
- Third: Self-Initiated and Self-Controlled Ask, for each part of the outcome, “How am I connected with this outcome through things that I directly cause?” ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=276))
- In other words, describe the circumstances of your outcome. In whose presence should it occur? ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=289))
- Personal ecology means that you consider your personal needs, aspirations, and values in the outcome. Personal ecology gives an important edge to your plans because it brings about inner alignment. If any part of you feels at all uncomfortable with the outcome, then you should add, remove, or improve whatever aspects of your outcome needed to eliminate this discomfort. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=293))
- NLP offers five primary categories for strategies, based on what they are intended for: 1. Decision strategies, or how we make a decision, 2. Motivation strategies, or how we get motivated to do something, 3. Reality strategies, or how we form our opinions, 4. Learning strategies, or how we learn to do something, 5. Memory strategies, or how we recall what we have learned or experienced ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=326))
- What is the T.O.T.E. Model? ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=336))
- Part of NLP’s job is to examine how people create their maps. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=358))
- Meta-programs determine what strategy a person uses or even creates in order to accomplish something. As you know, strategies are the method someone uses to get a result, even an internal result such as making a decision. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=376))
- One of the most important things educational research is telling us is that translating learning activities and information into all three modes of seeing, hearing and feeling is very important. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=388))
- What are the Learning Levels? NLP helps us track our learning by spelling out five levels of learning. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=390))
- The beauty of rep systems is that they go way beyond how things get into your brain. You can recall and think about your experiences, and create new ones, with the power of your mind. Much of the power of NLP comes from your ability to work with rep systems. Another phrase for rep system is sense modality. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=437))
- Those are the obvious rep systems: the five senses. But there are two factors that give rep systems great value in understanding and achieving excellence. The first is how we talk to ourselves, or hear what others have said. We call this the auditory digital rep system. Changing the talk inside our minds is a very powerful tool. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=445))
- Do you remember when we talked about strategies? The way a person sequences and selects rep systems is a strategy. There is a rep system strategy for everything we do. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=459))
- People will tell you what rep system they are using without even knowing it. The secret is in their words. If they talk about how things look, what they saw, colors, and other visual words, they are thinking in pictures quite a bit. They are mostly using their visual rep system. So that is their preferred rep system. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=465))
- Let’s say you want to sell me a vacation package. Listen to this, and ask yourself what rep system I’m using. “I just don’t SEE how I can afford to take a vacation.” ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=477))
- a trust-building technique you can start using right away. It’s called matching predicates. As you talk to people, practice using the same rep system that they are. See how this affects how they act toward you. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=501))
- As you talk to people, practice using the same rep system that they are. See how this affects how they act toward you. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=502))
- What are the common Eye Accessing Cues? ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=517))
- To review, as if you’re facing them, and see their eyes going: • Up left is visual constructing. • Up right is visual recalled. • Directly / laterally left is auditory constructing. • Directly / laterally right is auditory recall. • Down left is kinesthetic. • Down right is verbal memory or self talk. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=527))
- Since I asked you to look at the tree, we were using the visual rep system. The submodalities were clarity, brightness and color saturation. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=544))
- When a submodality is digital, what we really mean is that it contains information expressed using known symbols. ([Location 557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=557))
- All those other submodalities were analogue. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=560))
- Which modality is strongest in creating that good feeling? ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=578))
- This employee has had very good experiences with people. Pretty much everyone has. This means the employee has resources he can use to change his behavior. In one state, he feels good about people. In the other state, he feels bad, and acts badly, too. Mapping across means you use the good state to change the bad one. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=591))
- The NLP presuppositions are the most important guidelines for learning and doing NLP, and for being successful in life. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=630))
- 1. “The ‘map’ is not the ‘territory’” (”the menu is not the meal”). We base our actions on our mental map of the world. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=633))
- 2. People respond according to their internal maps. ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=637))
- 5. Individual skills function by developing and sequencing rep systems. ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=651))
- 7. Person and behavior describe different phenomena. We “are” more than our behavior. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004LB5A0O&location=659))
