- To do that I needed to transform who I was, and how my meaning-making stories construct the reality I experience. I did this, and continue to transform myself, thanks to the Cognitive Developmental Framework [5,6] of Otto Laske, which is woven throughout this book, and covered in Part III. I started to get to know investors, economists, lawyers, social change leaders, developmental coaches, and all kinds of practitioners whom I had never known about before—and in some cases would never have wanted to talk to before. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=349))
- Adaptive Organisation approach, which integrates all three elements (legal incorporation, dynamic governance of roles and tasks, human development practices), to build antifragile organisations ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=362))
- fundamental flaw in one of the central assumptions of neoclassical economics. I showed the error in the deductive logic behind the assumption that the market economy could allocate resources efficiently, without external intervention and regulation by government and labour unions. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=403))
- We wish we could write the way Picasso painted: showing everything simultaneously. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=435))
- this book was more than an omnibus of stories that gave me hope and spelled optimism. It was a medley of practical tools, researched methodologies, and voices of reason, captured in a way that left me visualizing a vibrant cohesive world. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=469))
- We live in this very fading, graying old world, that often blocks us from seeing the vibrant, regenerative world we ought all to thrive in (depicted in bright hues of blue, green and purple). ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=482))
- Look for the eyes and faces in the new world, representing the capacity we most need now: to see what others cannot yet see, to imagine possibilities others cannot yet imagine, and to build what others cannot yet build. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=486))
- Reasons for Hope ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=500))
- Every valuable human being must be a radical and a rebel, for what they must aim at is to make things better than they are. —Niels Bohr[10] You may never know what results come from your action. But if you do nothing, there will be no result —Mahatma Gandhi ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=501))
- Doing differently at this scale requires each of us to become someone different, especially to give up hope of being certain. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=523))
- You might believe that a back-to-basics approach will work. Replicating what worked in the past but trying harder. However, in our emergent reality, where shift happens that you cannot control nor predict, everything is up for grabs. Solutions that once worked, work no longer. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=530))
- If you only learn more skills to predict better you will still fail, because you will still be acting from within the box of your current meaning-making stories. You need to build a bigger box of stories, by developing your adaptive capacity, and the adaptive capacity of your organisation, through getting increasingly better at recognising and embracing contradiction and ambiguity. ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=553))
- I hope this shows why it is an unhelpful, self-fulfilling prophecy to choose the doomist ‘we are doomed, total systems collapse is the only possible outcome’ stance: because the meaning-making you use co-creates the reality you experience. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=590))
- An emergent strategy creates a prosperous future through innovation and taking ownership of creating something new. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=612))
- a marriage of 26 years we could no longer live together. Initially, we tried to rekindle the vestiges of old sparks by recreating what had worked so well, so long ago: revisiting our honeymoon, and even wearing a favorite suit of mine that my wife had bought for our rehearsal dinner. Sadly, we realized that back-to-basics didn’t work. Circumstances had changed and we had changed, so rather than going back to the past and replicating what had magically worked then, we needed to move to the present. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=615))
- Kodak, ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=621))
- An emergent strategy is 90% about the stories, only 10% about the facts. We write the stories, and so we choose the future; we can choose the future we want, as Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac describe in their book The Future We Choose: Surviving the Climate Crisis[ ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=632))
- The story here begins with the Italian artist Giotto di Bondone (1276-1337), who convinced everyone (well, almost everyone) that art should have only one perspective: a human perspective. Before Giotto, European artists were expected to portray reality from God’s perspective, without depth. ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=640))
- Giotto shifted from God-centric to human-centric. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=647))
- Cubism sliced and diced the representation of an object, and presented simultaneously all sides from all perspectives. No single perspective is privileged in Cubism. ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=670))
- Newton assumed that mass, energy, space, ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=693))
- Einstein saw that if two of you observe the same events from widely different places, and / or you are moving at different speeds, you may well end up seeing a different sequence of events; and possibly even different events. ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=698))
- Richard Feynman, widely regarded as Einstein’s equal in his generation, said that if you do not find quantum physics confusing, then you do not understand it. Humans cannot understand it because we are one to two metres tall, and can only understand the world through the basic common sense and observation possible as a being that size. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=737))
- Nobel laureate Walter Heisenberg developed his uncertainty principle in 1927. The uncertainty principle reflects an inherent unknowability in nature that has nothing to do with our human ability to know. For example, an electron’s momentum and its position are a complementary pair. The more you know about an electron’s momentum, the less you can know about its position, and vice versa. This finally laid to rest the myth that ([Location 741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=741))
- Later in this book you will develop more clarity on how your meaning-making stories, your nature, and your capacity to use different thought forms, creates your reality, including your perception of risk and reward. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=761))
- Ubuntu recognises that none of us can become human, let alone our full selves, without the influence of everyone else around us. It reflects the full interconnectedness of everyone and everything. The meaning-making stories that define who you are today have been shaped by everybody that you and they have interacted with; ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=783))
- Any mid-something crisis has, at its root, the fact that the lenses and meaning-making stories that have worked for you before are failing you now. You have two choices: either you embrace the lesson that the world is giving you, and change the lenses and meaning-making stories that you use as maps to navigate your life, or you try to go back to your past. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=801))
- Otto Laske’s map of maps, the Constructive Developmental Framework (CDF)[5,6] especially useful. The CDF is the central foundation of our book. ([Location 805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=805))
- The bigger your adaptive capacity in different forms of thought (also called sense making), the more able you are to go beyond linear logic forms of thought, and deeper into the 28 different patterns often called meta-thinking, transformational thinking, or dialectic thinking. ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=823))
- Those of you who have read about Picasso and Einstein as people will know that they were not universally acclaimed as nice, comfortable people to spend time with. ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=843))
- As Peter Drucker says[25], when you hire someone with a superb strength in one area, you will always get with it an equally big weakness, so the organisation’s purpose is to make the strength productive and the weakness irrelevant through shaping the context. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=852))
- Many are at a stage where self-identity and expertise are synonymous, so any challenge to their discipline is interpreted as a challenge to self-identity, making it difficult or even impossible for them to deploy multiple lenses and maps. This is at the heart of much of the friction between different disciplines, and between society and the economists. ([Location 897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=897))
- Keen is pointing at the relevance to the reality that they shape of developmental stages of individuals and professional groups. Many professional groups have too many people who still derive their sense of self-identity and self-esteem from their expertise and their belonging to a community of similar experts. This is a barrier to addressing our global challenges when the expertise is well past its sell-by date. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=904))
- we close Part II with a concept that we hope will provoke the development of an approach to what we can say about economies that integrates everything valid across the full breadth of today’s complementary approaches. Taking general relativity as a metaphor, I propose a geometric approach to economics, which I suggest could be named a general theory of economies. ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=926))
- The Mont Fleur meetings[27], near Cape Town, were critical in developing the adaptive capacity ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=936))
- Through emergent dialogue they fully grasped the consequences of each other’s meaning-making stories, and the reality these stories were creating. Each group clearly understood that each strategy offered elements: needed in the desired future South Africa; and potentially sabotaging the journey to this desired new South Africa. ([Location 940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=940))
- The South African experience suggests five key ingredients for any successful adaptive strategy fit for our emergent reality filled with adaptive challenges. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=950))
- Recognise that the inherent, irreducible contradictions in your reality are real, not an artifact of right or wrong perspectives; and so all lenses must be used simultaneously to see all contradictions. ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=951))
- Accept that your meaning-making stories shape or even create the reality that you experience. ([Location 954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=954))
- For example, I am always asking myself how the final performance of an entire business can be improved by working on the smallest particles that make up that business and their interactions. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=999))
- As you will see in this book, you will get a far better handle on how to deliver the results your organisation expects from you, and that you are accountable for getting your organisation to deliver, by seeing both the interactions between the people in your organisation and the people in your organisation as equally foundational and independent. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1058))
- What would we get if we applied this thinking to your business? If the interaction has characteristics that are predefined, and that call into existence the nature of the particles that interact, what are these pairs? How does the predefined type of interaction create the very reality that the particles experience? ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1070))
    - Note: Roles, strong categories such as pm = business, design = creative [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- superb example is the map of the London tube. Early on, it showed each station in a faithful representation of its position on the surface of London. After a while, with lots of people struggling to use those maps, it became clear to Harry Beck in 1933 that knowing exactly where each tube station was, was irrelevant information. ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1086))
- Everyone knew that no choice could ever be right, since the transition was emergent, not predictive—right could only be known long afterwards. But an emergent map is still useful, because it gives guidance on which choices open up more potential for emergence, and therefore options for thriving; and which choices shut them down. ([Location 1097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1097))
- Most intractable arguments in families, business, and politics happen when you fail to realise that each of you is using different maps and lenses. ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1105))
    - Note: Viewing map as value system as well as… how to navigate (wardley), what is effective, how does change and meaningful transition happen?
      Also mental models seem relevant here [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- You cannot not use maps and lenses. The best you can do is recognise which ones you are using, and shift the dialogue, or argument, to focus on them all, not just the consequences of a specific map or lens. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1113))
    - Note: Could HBFF be saved by integrating all perspectives?? [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- In Evolutesix we look at conflict through the lens of developmental value. We see conflict as the most valuable resource that an individual or organisation has to understand where meaning-making stories fit their context and needs. ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1123))
- Picasso rejected using his father’s name, and instead took his mother’s. He realised early on that the name he had been using carried with it the story his father lived by. He rejected his father’s story of not ruffling anybody’s feathers, as he saw that this story had shaped his father’s reality as a mediocre artist. Picasso wanted to stand out, to make a difference, and his story centred on taking risks to do so. ([Location 1145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1145))
- This book is about recognising your stories, and mastering the skills of enabling your stories to rewrite themselves. You cannot rewrite them directly by using thought alone; they have a life of their own, just as in a book I (Graham) love, the Never Ending Story[34] by Michael Ende. ([Location 1189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1189))
- The only reality you can ever experience is your inner story now. Your inner reality is shaped by your entire history of experienced inner reality, not just in terms of the distilled memories that you use to attribute the meaning and shape your inner reality, but also in the very neurobiological hardware that you are using. ([Location 1236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1236))
- chimp, human, and computer. ([Location 1255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1255))
- Computer. The computer system is your library of stories and behaviours. Both the chimp and human systems consult the library, pull out the stories and behaviours they each think is best for you, and then fight with each other to drive your behaviours. The rest of this book is all about getting more books and behaviours into your library, your organisation’s library, and our economy’s library. ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1260))
- The physicist Richard Feynman used this Cargo Cult as a story [38,39] to show the difference between real science and scientism. In scientism people do the visible behaviours of a scientist, but without the underlying engine that makes science work. This engine is: using intuition very strongly to imagine how the world might work, and what you might be able to say about it; and then brutally doing all you can to rip your ideas and everybody else’s ideas to pieces. ([Location 1284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1284))
- Empiricism, or the scientific process, is far more than just collecting evidence, it is the brutal adherence to three key elements. ([Location 1299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1299))
- Letting go of what you believe you know to be true, ([Location 1300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1300))
- Actively disconnecting your self-worth from old meaning-making stories and your biases. ([Location 1302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1302))
- Always focus on finding evidence to prove something false, never look for evidence to prove something true. ([Location 1304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1304))
- conflict is very often simply hard data on a mismatch between my inner reality and actuality, or that someone else has different meaning-making to me, generating a different reality to mine from the same actuality. ([Location 1316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1316))
- If each of us are to rise to the adaptive challenges we are facing, we must get steadily better every day at harnessing, not managing, conflict. ([Location 1319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1319))
- 6 Inter-ecosystem All the layers below, plus the full emergent aspects of open systems in interaction with each other; 5 Inner-ecosystem e.g., The FairShares Commons or similar applied to the whole ecosystem and all companies within it, (see Parts II and IV); ([Location 1324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1324))
- 4 Inter-organisational The FairShares Commons or similar incorporation for almost all kinds of entities, except perhaps a pure trust, or a wholly owned subsidiary of a FairShares Commons; 3 Inner-organisational Extensions of sociocracy, Holacracy, and other forms of dynamic organisation design or governance (see Part IV); 2 Inter-personal Interactions between people, culture, etc. all belongs here. The Evolutesix Adaptive Way for teams, covered in Part IV, does this well; 1 Inner-personal Who I am, my inner voices and motivations, meaning-making etc. The Evolutesix Adaptive Way for individuals, in Part III, does this well. ([Location 1327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1327))
- Effectiveness at each level depends on how well generative conflict is harnessed. The Evolutesix Adaptive Way is designed to harness conflict, to the extent that we even have a pattern called Tiggering3 , which is about deliberately creating conflict when there is too little. ([Location 1339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1339))
- Whilst it’s only natural to want to blame and punish other people for being evil or criminal, especially the more you feel pain, anxiety, anger, or any other strong emotion, I believe that few of the people who played a role getting us into this mess were inherently bad. Almost all were not much different to you or me, simply doing what was in front of them to do, without sufficient understanding of the long-term implications of what they were doing, or how related any single action was to everything else that was happening. Simply a collective incompetence that required inhuman superpowers to see clearly in advance. ([Location 1374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1374))
- Your economy starts with stories, not unambiguous facts. ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1401))
- Just as physicists learnt a hundred years ago that physics is the study of what we can say, not the study of what is, so I see economics as the study of what we can say about the economy, e.g. how valuable goods and services flow within society from where they are abundant to where they are needed, not what the economy is. ([Location 1409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1409))
- Energy is valued by nature in days of life. For example, the value of a cup of oil is approximately one week of your life. Think of this next time you fill up your car with petrol or diesel. The true value of each litre that you use to drive away from the filling station is one month of your life, not the money you paid2 ([Location 1458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1458))
- The old lenses we’ve used to look at the economy distort it, just as the Mercator projection distorts land area in such a way that very few people realise how much smaller the USA is than, say, the north-western corner of Africa. These lenses hold us back from seeing clearly the trends in society and the natural ecosystems that human life depends completely on. Because we fail to see actuality clearly, we construct a poor reality, and so too many are still failing miserably to see the imperative to act now. ([Location 1496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1496))
- narrative economics, and the topic of a very recent book of that name by Robert Schiller[48]. At last, the lessons from psychology of individuals and business performance, that the dominant meaning-making stories shape the reality that is experienced, are entering economics. ([Location 1527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1527))
    - Note: Much of the engagement with narrative reminds me of CLA and narrative inquiry. What is the story driving the future company and future you? 
      Tall poppy with regards to hero and to wal-mart. What part does each individual on the team play in transforming their own narratives to be part of the larger future narrative? Will it be business as usual? 
      I can’t lead a transformation like that;;; I have no experience of it. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- The dramatic narrowing of specialisation driven by the increase in total knowledge, meaning that in the near future the average knowledge worker will know less than 1% of what they need to do their job, compared to 75% in 1985. ([Location 1650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=1650))
- “Who am I?” is as the integration of three elements. Your genes, their epigenetic expressions, and brain structures shaped in early childhood (hardware and firmware) fix your fundamental uniqueness, your natural strengths and weaknesses. You assembling raw input into complete puzzles that make sense, with the puzzle pieces coming in from all your senses, and including feelings. You then giving meaning to the assembled puzzle through your meaning-making stories. These three are the foundations of the Constructive Developmental Framework (CDF), described comprehensively by Otto Laske in two volumes[ ([Location 3405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3405))
- unchanging and valid for all time, to the question Who am I, and who should I be? I’ll call this the naked you vs. the dressed you, borrowing from the concept in physics of dressed vs. naked particles. ([Location 3463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3463))
- Growing your capacity for awareness enables you to see more and more clearly everything you are as the fully dressed you, and to know that this is the real you. The smaller your capacity for awareness, the more likely you are to mistake a small part of your fully dressed you for being all you are; or, to seek your naked you, which is fundamentally impossible to see. Your dressed you is inherently nebulous, like a cloud changing shape each time you look at it, because each time you look at it you change microscopically your stories, which changes the dressed “you”. ([Location 3469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3469))
- Over the past few decades research into personality is confirming that, in a very deep sense, your stories are who you are. You have constructed these stories over your life, and they in turn have constructed your personality and the reality that you experience now. You are a dynamic path across time, not a static thing in time. Analogous to quantum mechanics. You construct your stories by distilling the reality you experienced across your life path into scripts defining who you are and what you should do for whom, which then shapes or even creates the reality you experience, which in turn shapes and creates the stories that run you[ ([Location 3492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3492))
- Every time you face a new challenge, you decide whether to engage this challenge by reapplying one or more of the stories that has worked for you in the past, or to let go of everything that has worked for you in the past and figure out how to overcome this challenge from scratch. ([Location 3556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3556))
- All life learns to be ruthlessly efficient with energy. If you run out of physical energy, your physical body dies. If you run out of emotional and psychological energy, you are quite likely to sink into a motionless ball of misery curled up on the sofa bingeing on Netflix and Pringles. So taking the risk to create completely new stories from scratch is a high-risk strategy because it has a high demand on both your physical and psychological energy. So what should you look for, to decide when it’s time to take a blank section of film and write a completely new story from scratch? When the challenge that you are facing is an adaptive challenge, not a technical one. ([Location 3560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3560))
- If it is an adaptive challenge, though, you can only rise to the challenge by changing yourself. You will need to add one or more ways of thinking, you will need to change and grow your stories, and you may need to add more subtlety to how you deal with your hardwired nature. Most likely you will also need to do everything described above for a technical challenge, as most adaptive challenges also have a technical component.

- One sure sign that you are facing an adaptive challenge is when nothing you try works, and nothing you can imagine trying looks any better. You feel trapped at the bottom of a 20m well, with no way out. ([Location 3578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3578))
- If you are a leader of any sort, most of your challenges will be adaptive challenges. You must become adept at changing yourself and supporting others in them changing themselves. Never attempt to change anyone else directly, though; it will backfire. You cannot write a new story for them; all you can do is support them in creating a context they choose because they believe will facilitate them seeing their own meaning making clearly, and allow it to rewrite itself. No company or manager has the right to demand any specific change in anyone else, they can only point out the business needs and implications of those needs. ([Location 3581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3581))
- Technical challenges Adaptive challenges Easy to identify. Hard to identify, and so easy to deny Easy to solve, best or good practice solutions exist No existing solution. Can only be solved by changing your stories and thinking, especially your relationships to people, work, and how you see yourself in your roles Experts can give you the solution You have to do the work yourself Only a few changes within your existing stories and boundaries are enough Change everywhere, especially to your stories and boundaries It’s easy to see and buy into the technical solution You are unwilling or unable to see the challenge clearly, and that technical solutions are incapable of solving the challenge The solutions are relatively quick to implement The solutions take time, demanding repeated prototypes and learning from failing until a viable solution is found ([Location 3590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3590))
- However, research in psychology is showing with steadily growing clarity how widely different the histories are for people dealing with the same meaning-making stories; and that rewriting those stories depends more on the growth experiences you construct now, and far less on having a deep understanding of your past. ([Location 3640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3640))
    - Note: Focus on future rather then understanding The past. Create new growth experiences [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- If you know which category your current stories belong to, you can see more clearly which experiences you need to create for yourself so that you can grow your story templates towards the next category. ([Location 3724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3724))
- 8.1.1 Stages of meaning making The six stages are listed below and depicted in Figure 8.1. ([Location 3747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3747))
- S4: Self-authoring mind. Your stories are now centred on the values and unique concept of integrity that you have created for yourself independently of other people’s expectations. ([Location 3756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3756))
- What I see depends on which lens(es) I choose to use, out of the infinitely many lenses I could use. Each lens shows a part of what actually is, with some kind of distortion, but none can possibly show all that actually is without any distortion. Every time you judge yourself as a success, or as a failure, check which lens you are using to look at the data. Then ask yourself, which data is completely hidden by that lens, and which data is distorted by that lens? ([Location 3869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3869))
- Success and failure lie purely in the lenses and frames of reference you are able to use, and in whether or not you give these lenses and frames of reference any validity. Which depends on your stories, and how strongly you believe in them. I’m getting better ([Location 3879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3879))
- 8.2 Grow better, bigger stories ([Location 3894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3894))
- The ground pattern is a sophisticated dialogue tool, both for your inner dialogue, and for dialogue with others, to recognise and transform meaning-making stories. ([Location 3901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3901))
- Many approaches to developing yourself begin with complaints, as the ground pattern does, but instead then exhort you to declare yourself to just be different or do differently, without providing any viable way of changing the underlying meaning-making stories that are who you are and that create the reality you experience. So they fail, at best; and at worst, are contributing to the growing rise of depression and other psychological issues[147]. ([Location 3907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3907))
- you can benefit from getting more clarity on your commitment by mining them out of your complaints. ([Location 3924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3924))
- Unlike what many managers think, complaints are valuable. Encouraging complaints in order to mine the value in them gives you what you need to develop. Look at complaints as the best that you can do, within your current reality, to communicate to yourself and the people around you that something is not sufficiently fit for purpose. The worst thing that anyone, let alone someone leading a process, can do, is to shut down your talking about what you can feel but cannot yet articulate. Feelings are hard data that cannot be put into rational words. ([Location 3925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3925))
- Keep it simple, approach it playfully with an improv mindset, and move forwards fast, but imperfectly. Be a playful entrepreneur or leader[ ([Location 3941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3941))
- Sometimes it feels clumsy to use the full sentence stem. Instead you might want to say, for example, I’m committed to building my website or building my website is important to me. ([Location 3943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3943))
- Is this expressed clearly as something universal, or at least something that many people will share with you? For example, I’m committed to being honest is about you. I’m committed to the importance of / need for honesty ([Location 3952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=3952))
- 8.2.3 GP step 3: Resolutions to hidden commitments Purpose: identify which hidden commitments are at the core of your blocking behaviours, because they are actually there to protect you from perceived harm. Shift from a blame, shame-driven paradigm of resolutions (declarations that tomorrow you will be a different person) to a compassion driven paradigm of exploring your vulnerabilities. ([Location 4010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4010))
- All our lives we are doing daily the equivalent to a solo unprotected climb. Trying to simply push against who you are is only going to get yourself hurt, and lead to far poorer results in your startup than you could otherwise achieve. ([Location 4032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4032))
- The hidden commitment is a commitment to avoid or prevent something we believe may harm us. It may be as obvious and natural as avoiding situations where we might fall off a cliff. Or as subtle as avoiding situations where we might be praised. Your hidden commitments have some value, and should never be just violently squashed. ([Location 4034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4034))
- Your aspirational commitments and hidden commitments are like opposing teams in a football match, or in a tug of war, but you are both teams. ([Location 4075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4075))
- Purpose: identify the big assumptions behind the hidden commitments, and that are a subcategory of the meaning-making stories that drive your choices and behaviours. ([Location 4086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4086))
- Experiments (Transformational Exit) Walker, there is no path. The path is made by walking —(Antonio Machado) The purpose here is to create experiences that will give you clarity on what you can and cannot change in your meaning-making stories; and that will enable your stories to rewrite themselves, so that they are appropriate to your present and future life, not only your past. So that you steer your actions and your life, rather than it being mis-steered by events and your internally generated reality. ([Location 4200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4200))
- That is why we emphasise that the Adaptive Way is a way of life, learnt in a dojo and mastered in practice with colleagues, friends, and family. It is not a one-off training. ([Location 4209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4209))
- This is unavoidable, you will always generate your reality by making meaning with stories that are from a younger you. ([Location 4211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4211))
- Before running experiments to test and learn about your unique combination of meaning-making stories, hardwired nature, and your fluidity of using different forms of thought, most people find it helpful to keep an eye on themselves and maintain two lists for each meaning-making story. A list of all situations where you notice your hidden commitment kicking in to protect a vulnerability. A list of all situations that are very close to the first list, but for some reason your hidden commitment stays asleep.

- A root cause of many mistakes we make is when your capacity for Type 2 thinking is not enough for the VUCA challenge we are facing. ([Location 4403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4403))
- 28 post-logical thought forms ([Location 4418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4418))
- Otto Laske’s second volume[6] and Metathinking[156] by Nick Shannon and Bruno Frischherz for full details) ([Location 4418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4418))
- Otto Laske has distilled out this complete set of 28 thought forms, in four groups of seven each, summarised in Table 9.1. Context: these are thought forms that you use to fully grasp the static aspect of actuality. If you are only able to use context for forms, inner reality will be static, although perhaps extraordinarily complex. Process: these are thought forms that you use to fully grasp opposites and simple changes or processes from one state to another. Process thought forms create an inner reality that far better represents the movement, change, and paradox of actuality. Relationship, or relatedness: these thought forms go even further, giving you the capacity to grasp what is common, and the relationships between aspects of actuality that at first sight seem to have nothing to do with each other. They also give you the capacity to recognise relationship as an element of actuality in its own right, independent of any two specific things that are in relationship. Transformation: the most advanced forms of thought, build on the foundation of context, process, and relationship thought forms. These transformational thought forms give you the capacity to rise to the biggest adaptive challenges. ([Location 4434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4434))
- Sense-making is the name we give to the process of assembling what you are aware of into a complete representation of actuality. If you have distorted this representation because you lack the necessary fluidity in the appropriate thought forms, the next stage of meaning making will be even more distorted. ([Location 4510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4510))
- Be very aware of this with anyone trying to help you from a purely behavioural paradigm; especially if you are trying to help yourself by bullying yourself into new behaviours! ([Location 4863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4863))
- If your nature has given you exceptional natural talents in responding immediately and creatively to unplannable crises, don’t waste your time in trying to become good at planning predictable processes. If your nature has given you exceptional talent and energy at connecting with people, don’t try to become an analyst sitting alone with vast tables of data.

- There are some activities that you will find naturally give you energy, and some activities that you will find invariably drain you of energy. Look at these carefully over the course of at least a week, and you will get useful clues to what I like to call your personal energy economy. ([Location 4870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4870))
- To get a good enough idea of your natural energy economy, think of the different kinds of tasks that give you or take your energy across the following four categories: ([Location 4876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4876))
- Exploring If you get energy from always doing new things, from creating on a blank sheet of paper, you are naturally an explorer. Most likely you lose energy if you need to use a process more than once or twice, or go on holiday to the same destination for the third time. You have a high need for significance, to see the big picture, and want your work to matter. ([Location 4877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4877))
- Vibrant If you get energy from meeting people, from talking about what excites you and what excites them, and you love seeing people getting energised with shiny eyes after talking to you, you most likely have a vibrant energy. ([Location 4880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4880))
- Systems If you get energy by spending time alone, working with facts and data to get to the right answer, you’ll score high on systems in your natural energy profile. ([Location 4886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4886))
- Read more on why most type indicators are seldom helpful, and can be harmful, in section 11.3.2. ([Location 4892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4892))
- Vision, Ideas, Big picture Dynamic, bubbly, intuitive You get energy starting things Decision making: Intuition, reflection first Vibrancy total: Variety, Growth, Participation Passionate, extroverted, excited Great at meeting new people Decisions making: through dialogue with others Context total: Timing, Delivery, Perception Compassionate, team player, sensory You get energy by getting things done with others Decision making: guided by one of more senses Systems total: Process, Data, Quality Detailed, orderly, introverted You get energy completing things Decision making: Analytical, data first ([Location 4902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4902))
- The higher your score in the four energies, the more that these activities are natural energy givers for you. You could call your highest energy your sun energy, because the more time you spend doing activities of this type, the more energy pours into you. ([Location 4922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QTJQBJS&location=4922))
- One of my (Graham) highest needs is freedom. This is very closely related to my natural explorer energy profile. If I do not have enough freedom, I will break out sooner rather than later, whatever the cost, to meet my need for freedom.

- In the language of this book, you cannot solve an adaptive challenge with the same Size of Person that created it. In this book the phrase Size of Person (SoP) is your total three-dimensional capacity, as described in the previous three chapters: to fluidly use the 28 transformational thought forms; how far along the stages of meaning-making you are; and your capacity to work subtly and wisely with your hardwired nature, including your capacity to manage your emotional state.
