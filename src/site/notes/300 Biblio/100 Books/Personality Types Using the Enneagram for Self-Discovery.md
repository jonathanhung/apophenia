- *Average:* Engage in “people pleasing” in order to be closer to others, becoming overly friendly, emotionally demonstrative, and full of “good intentions.” Bestow seductive attention on others: approval, “strokes,” flattery. Talkative, especially about love and their relationships. / Become overly intimate and intrusive: they need to be needed, so they hover, meddle, and control in the name of love. Want others to depend on them: give, but expect a return. Send mixed messages. Enveloping and possessive: the self-sacrificial, parenting persons who cannot do enough for others, wearing themselves out for everyone, creating needs for themselves to fulfill. / Increasingly self-important and self-satisfied, feel they are indispensable, although they overrate their efforts in others’ behalf. Seek specific forms of repayment for their help. Hypochondria, becoming a “martyr” for others. Overbearing, patronizing, presumptuous.

- But what Twos do not always remember is that, at its highest, love is more closely aligned with realism than with feelings. Genuine love wants what is best for the other, even if it means risking the relationship. Love wants the beloved to become strong and independent, even if it means that the Two must withdraw from the other’s life ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqdq7mne2cr3sexjes6efedb))

- They see themselves as loving, caring people, yet all too often they love others only to manipulate others to love them in return. Their “love” is not free: expectations of repayment are attached. Twos are often hampered in their ability to truly love others because their self-image is highly invested in having only certain positive feelings for people, and not having other “unpleasant” feelings.

- A life devoted to the collection of enjoyable or “interesting” experiences is an empty life. It is not a life of spirit, but one in which spirit disappears in the multitude of diversions. . . . ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h64qv85g6e4yzapx8r6x0yfs))
    - Note: a good life is not one full of enjoyment as those can be empty diversions [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
