- The number of psychologists, psychiatrists, marriage and family counselors, social workers, and “life coaches” is increasing every year. Yet despite all this help and advice, human unhappiness does not seem to be diminishing ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=176))

- Why Is It So Difficult to Be Happy? To answer this question, let’s take a journey back in time. The modern human mind, with its amazing ability to analyze, plan, create, and communicate has largely evolved over the last hundred thousand years, since our species, Homo sapiens, first appeared on the planet. But our minds did not evolve to make us “feel good” so we could tell jokes, write poems, or say “I love you.” Our minds evolved to help us survive in a world fraught with danger.

- Another essential for the survival of any early human is to belong to a group. If your clan boots you out, it won’t be long before the wolves find you. So how does the mind protect you from rejection by the group? By comparing you with other members of the clan: Am I fitting in? Am I doing the right thing? Am I contributing enough? Am I as good as the others? Am I doing anything that might get me rejected? ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=201))

- how hard we try to hold on to them, they slip away every time. And as we shall see, a life spent in pursuit of those good feelings is, in the long term, deeply unsatisfying. In fact, the harder we chase after pleasurable feelings, the more we are likely to suffer from anxiety and depression.

- When we take action on the things that truly matter deep in our hearts, move in directions that we consider valuable and worthy, clarify what we stand for in life and act accordingly, then our lives become rich and full and meaningful, and we experience a powerful sense of vitality. This is not some fleeting feeling—it is a profound sense of a life well lived. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=227))

- This book is like a trip through a foreign country: much will seem strange and new. Other things will seem familiar yet somehow subtly different. At times you may feel challenged or confronted, at other times excited or amused. Take your time on this journey. Instead of rushing ahead, savor it fully. Stop when you find something stimulating or unusual. Explore it in depth and learn as much as you can. To create a life worth living is a major undertaking, so please take the time to appreciate it.

- The overwhelming majority of self-help programs subscribe to Myth 4. The basic claim is: if you challenge your negative thoughts or images and, instead, repeatedly fill your head with positive thoughts and images, you will find happiness. If only life were that simple! ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=286))
    - topic:: [[orange\|orange]] 
- But you’ve probably also discovered that as your level of distress increases, your ability to control your feelings progressively lessens. Sadly, Myth 4 is so widely believed that we tend to feel inadequate when our attempts to control our thoughts and feelings fail.

- The fact is that most people are not open or honest about the struggle they go through with their own thoughts and feelings. They “put on a brave face” and “keep a stiff upper lip.” They are like the proverbial clown crying on the inside; the bright face paint and chirpy antics are all we see. I commonly hear my clients say things like, “If my friends/family/colleagues could hear me now, they’d never believe it. Everyone thinks I’m so strong/confident/happy/independent.” ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=344))

- When Penny eventually plucked up the courage to share her experiences with the other women, her admission broke a conspiracy of silence. The other mothers had all been feeling the same way to one degree or another, but they’d all been putting on the same act of bravado, hiding their true feelings for fear of disapproval or rejection. There was a huge sense of relief and bonding as these women opened up and got honest with one another. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=352))

- What do you cherish most in life? Health? Work? Family? Friends? Religion? Sports? Nature? It’s no surprise that life is richer and more fulfilling when we actively invest our time and energy in the things that are most important or meaningful to us. Yet all too often our attempts to avoid unpleasant feelings get in the way of doing what we truly value. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=489))

- The happiness trap is built through ineffective control strategies. In order to feel happy, we try hard to control what we’re feeling. But these control strategies have three significant costs: They take up a lot of time and energy and are usually ineffective in the long run. We feel silly, defective, or weak-minded because the thoughts/ feelings we’re trying to get rid of keep coming back. Many strategies that decrease unpleasant feelings in the short term actually lower our quality of life over the long term.

- Great advice about how to improve your life comes at you from all directions: find a meaningful job, do this great workout, get out in nature, take up a hobby, join a club, contribute to charity, learn new skills, have fun with your friends, and so on. And all these activities can be deeply satisfying if you do them because they are genuinely important and meaningful to you. But if these activities are used mainly to escape from unpleasant thoughts and feelings, chances are, they won’t be very rewarding. Why not? Because it’s hard to enjoy what you’re doing while you’re trying to escape from something threatening. ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=562))

- So, when you do things because they are truly meaningful to you, because deep in your heart they truly matter to you, those actions would not be classified as control strategies. They would be called “values-guided actions” (I’ll explain that term later), and they would be expected to improve your life in the long term. But if those very same actions are mainly motivated by experiential avoidance—if their primary purpose is to get rid of bad thoughts and feelings—then they would be called control strategies (and it would be very surprising if you found them truly fulfilling).

- Psychological flexibility is the ability to adapt to a situation with awareness, openness, and focus and to take effective action, guided by your values. ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=620))

- I should also warn you that as you work through this book, there is one key point I’ll be repeating again and again: you won’t change your life simply by reading this book. To do that, you will have to take action. It’s like reading a travel guide about India: by the end of it, you have a lot of ideas about where you’d like to visit, but you still haven’t been there. To truly experience India, you have to make the effort to get up and go there. ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=626))
- In ACT, our main interest in a thought is not whether it’s true or false, but whether it’s helpful; that is, if we pay attention to this thought, will it help us create the life we want? ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=674))

- All too often we react to our thoughts as if they are the absolute truth or as if we must give them all our attention. The psychological jargon for this reaction is “fusion.” ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=688))
    - topic:: [[orange\|orange]] 
- In a state of fusion, it seems as if: Thoughts are reality—what we’re thinking is actually happening, here and now. Thoughts are the truth—we completely believe them. Thoughts are important—we take them seriously and give them our full attention. Thoughts are orders—we automatically obey them. Thoughts are wise—we assume they know best, and we follow their advice. Thoughts can be threats—some thoughts can be deeply disturbing or frightening, and we feel the need to get rid of them.

- Remember as you use the techniques, the aim of defusion is not to get rid of a thought, but simply to see it for what it is—just a string of words—and to let it be there without fighting it. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=729))

- Once you’ve acknowledged a story, that’s it—just let it be. You don’t have to challenge it or push it away, nor do you have to give it much attention. Simply let it come and go as it pleases, while you channel your energy into doing something you value.

- Anytime you’re feeling stressed, anxious, or depressed, ask yourself, “What story is my mind telling me now?” Then once you’ve identified it, defuse it. ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=783))

- wastes a lot of energy. The more useful approach is to ask, “Is this thought helpful? Does it help me take action to create the life I want?” If it’s helpful, pay attention. If it’s not, defuse it. ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=800))

- We have many thousands of useless or unhelpful thoughts every day. And no matter how harsh, cruel, silly, vindictive, critical, frightening, or downright weird they may be, we can’t prevent them from popping up. But just because they appear doesn’t mean we have to take them seriously. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=848))

- Develop the courage to solve those problems that can be solved, the serenity to accept those problems that can’t be solved, and the wisdom to know the difference. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=1000))
    - topic:: [[orange\|orange]] 
- Remember, you don’t have to like a thought in order to accept it. It’s okay to want to get rid of it. In fact, it’s expected. But wanting to get rid of something is quite different from actively struggling with it. For example, suppose you have an old car that you no longer want. And suppose you won’t have an opportunity to sell it for at least another month. You can want to get rid of the car and simultaneously accept that you still have the car. You don’t have to try to smash the car up, ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=1013))

- Ask yourself: How would I act differently if painful thoughts and feelings were no longer an obstacle? What projects or activities would I start (or continue) if my time and energy weren’t consumed by troublesome emotions? What would I do if fear were no longer an issue? What would I attempt if thoughts of failure didn’t deter me? ([Location 1295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004XI12O8&location=1295))
