- “Time is an illusion, a construct made out of human memory. There’s no such thing as the past, the present, or the future. It’s all happening now.” ([Location 1506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=1506))
- We are homesick most for the places we have never known. —CARSON MCCULLERS ([Location 1513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=1513))
- You could experience events in your life in any order. Relive any memory you want.” “But that’s…it’s…ridiculous. And it breaks cause and effect.” Slade smiles that superior smile again. Still one step ahead. “Quantum physics is on my side here, I’m afraid. We already know that on the particle level, the arrow of time isn’t as simple as humans think it is.” “You really believe time is an illusion?” “More like our perception of it is so flawed that it may as well be an illusion. Every moment is equally real and happening now, but the nature of our consciousness only gives us access to one slice at a time.

- Before they could get the tank open, everyone in the lab was suddenly standing in a slightly different position. Our noses were all bleeding, some of us had splitting headaches, and instead of Jon Jordan in the tank, you were running an experiment on a guy named Michael Dillman. It all happened in the blink of an eye, like someone had flipped a switch. “No one understood what had happened. We had no records of Jordan ever setting foot in our lab. We were rattled, trying to make sense of it all. Call it misguided curiosity, but I couldn’t let it go. I tried to locate Jordan, to see what had happened to him, where he had gone, and it was the strangest thing—that car-accident memory we were reactivating? Turns out he had actually died in that wreck alongside his wife, fifteen years earlier.” ([Location 1583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=1583))
- is déjà vu actually the specter of false timelines that never happened but did, casting their shadows upon reality? ([Location 1872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=1872))
- It has crossed her mind that one solution to all of this would be to kill Slade. ([Location 1968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=1968))
- moves to Anchorage, Alaska, where she volunteers as a research assistant for a neuroscientist at the university—a kind man who has no idea that one of his underlings is the preeminent research scientist in the world. ([Location 1973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=1973))
- Barry looks up at a white Art Deco tower with a crown of glass and steel, a knot forming in the pit of his stomach. “What floor?” he asks. “I’m sorry?” “What floor did she jump from?” An ambulance screams past, lights and sirens blaring as it barrels through the intersection straight ahead. “Forty-one. Looks like another FMS suicide.” ([Location 2108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=2108))
- “You’re scaring me, Jules. What’s wrong?” She looks at him, trembling. “Have you heard of False Memory Syndrome?” ([Location 2137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=2137))
- “I promise I will explain everything, but right now, we have to go to Meghan.” “Why?” “Because she’s experiencing the same thing you are. She’s remembering her own death.” ([Location 2156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=2156))
- “I have this memory. It wasn’t there before. I was fifteen, walking to Dairy Queen to see my friends. I was on the phone, wasn’t thinking, went to cross the street. I remember the sound of a car engine. I turned and stared into the oncoming headlights. I remember the car hitting me and then lying on my back, thinking how stupid I was. I didn’t hurt that much, but I couldn’t move, and everything was going dark. I couldn’t see, and I knew what was coming. I knew it meant the end of everything. Are you sure I’m not dead?” ([Location 2185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=2185))
- He pulls it out and reads a text from Meghan: Dad. I can’t do this anymore. I don’t know who I am. I don’t know anything except I don’t belong here. I’m so sorry. I love you always. He slides off the stool. ([Location 2299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=2299))
- “It will be destructive at first, like all progress. Just as the industrial age ushered in two world wars. Just as Homo sapiens supplanted the Neanderthal. But would you turn back the clock on all that comes with it? Could you? Progress is inevitable. And it’s a force for good.” ([Location 2791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=2791))
- “Look, I know there’s an argument to be made that the chair should be eradicated from the face of the Earth. That it’s an affront to the natural order of things. But it just saved nineteen kids and erased the unfathomable pain of their families.” ([Location 3047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=3047))
- It begins sooner than anyone anticipates. Shaw walks into the lab on March 22 for their daily briefing of all the horrible shit that’s happened in the world in the past twenty-four hours and says, “We have our first mandated assignment.” “From whom?” Raj asks. “Way up the food chain.” “So they know?” Helena asks. “Yes.” ([Location 3241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=3241))
- “Let me say this! It’s enough that I have to see the chair destroying the entire world. People throwing themselves off of buildings because of something I made. It’s another to see it ruin the life of the man I love.” “Life with you isn’t a life ruined.” ([Location 3718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07HDSHP7N&location=3718))
