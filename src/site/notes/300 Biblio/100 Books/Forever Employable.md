- Jin suggests a three-part model in the form of a pyramid. At the base of the pyramid is a large, free audience cultivated by way of opt-in email lists or horizontal social platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, or Facebook. The middle of the pyramid—which comprises a smaller group of people—includes members of the free audience who have been converted into donors and patrons who are willing to pay a nominal amount of money to help keep your venture afloat. At the very top of the pyramid are the subscribers and high-value purchasers—your 100 True Fans—willing to pay $1,000 a year or more to personally interact with you and have access to exclusive and extra content that provides them with meaningful value. The first step to building this pyramid? Plant your flag. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B086S5SJXM&location=364))
