- When we talked about early traumatic grief as a *wound*, he understood that in the context of his own military service: “If I had encountered an IED in the field that exploded and I lost my legs or arms, I would *have to* focus on myself.” Yes, he understood — he got that self-focus could be honorable and appropriate. Grieving, he had to attend to his own wounds — perhaps foremost. And ultimately, when we take good care of ourselves, we are better able to take care of others. Far from being selfish, in a way self-care in acute grief is heroic.
  This is the place of heart-turned-inward.
  ATTENDING to the self-focused, self-caring place of heart-turned-inward doesn’t mean we stay in that place, always and forever. That, too, changes. We will move, vacillating between self and other, heart-in and heart-out, over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn8n0q0egdkq50ht1dpbry7m))
- What this means for grievers is that we may have what I call *re-grieving* days, days when acutely experienced grief reemerges months, years, or decades later on a special day, holidays, or without any particular cue or prompt. On re-grieving days, grief moves to the foreground again, and we may feel weepier than usual, tenderhearted, and vulnerable.

- So her self-care list included items that could be done in only a few minutes: stretch, watch clouds, doodle, read a poem, write a thank-you note, just sit. If she had five to ten minutes, she might listen to music, dance in her office, cry or laugh, sing, take a short walk, write a haiku, make a cup of special tea, journal, meditate or pray, clear her space, color, or take a photograph that captured how she felt. If she had thirty minutes, she might also meditate or pray, exercise or do yoga, connect with another person over tea, start a new book, get into nature, do something kind for someone else, clean out a drawer, make art, or send a family member a loving letter.
