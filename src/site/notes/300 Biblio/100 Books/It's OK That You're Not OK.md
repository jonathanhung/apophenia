- Every one of us had felt judged, shamed, and corrected in our grief. We shared stories of being encouraged to “get over it,” put the past behind us, and stop talking about those we had lost. We were admonished to move on with our lives and told we needed these deaths in order to learn what was important in life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn67hyw20zqyybhkmhrhaqjv))
- I have a theory (as yet scientifically unproven) that the more random or out-of-order the loss, the more judgment and correction the grieving person hears. It’s like we just can’t reconcile the fact that someone could be alive and well at breakfast and dead by lunch. We can’t understand how someone who ate well, exercised, and was a generally good human being can get cancer and die at the age of thirty-four. We can’t understand how a perfectly healthy child can drop dead of what started as a simple cough. How someone biking to work, using a dedicated bike lane, wearing reflective clothing, their bike adorned with flashing lights, can be struck and killed in an instant.

- There is no need to rush redemption.
  Hard, painful, terrible things happen. That is the nature of being alive, here in this world. Not everything works out; everything doesn’t happen for a reason. The real path here, the real way forward, is not in denying that irredeemable pain exists, but by acknowledging that it does. By becoming a culture strong enough to bear witness to pain, when pain is what is. By sticking together inside what hurts. By opening ourselves to one another’s pain, knowing that this, too, could be us the next time around.
  When we’re afraid of loss, we cling to a system of right and wrong, of well and unwell, to safeguard our connections to those we love. We think barricading ourselves against pain and suffering will help us survive.
  Our deeply embedded aversion to pain and hardship—to acknowledging pain and hardship—keeps us from what we most want: safety. Safety in the form of love, connection, and kinship. We defend ourselves against losing it, but in doing so, we keep ourselves from living it.
  The tricky thing is, true survival never exists in a world where we have to lie about our own hearts, or pretend we’re more in control than we are. It just makes us desperately more anxious and more rabid in our attempts to make everything work out in the end.
  The most efficient and effective way to be “safe” in this world is to stop denying that hard and impossible things happen. Telling the truth allows us to connect, to fully enter the experience of another and *feel with them*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gngfdnswc1185nzr5w18cc4b))
- Real safety is in entering each other’s pain, recognizing ourselves inside it. As one of my oldest teachers used to say, poignancy is kinship. It’s evidence of connection. That we hurt for each other shows our relatedness. Our limbic systems, our hearts, and our bodies are made for this; we long for that connection.
  That you see your own potential for grief and loss in someone else’s grief? That’s beautiful. Poignancy is kinship.
  When emotion comes up, we can let that poignancy run through us. It hurts, but it hurts because we’re related, because we’re connected. It should hurt. There’s nothing wrong with that. When we recognize pain and grief as a healthy response to loss, we can respond with skill and grace, rather than blame and bypass. We can respond by loving one another, no matter what happens.
  Finding safety means to come together, with open hearts and a willing curiosity about everything we experience: love, joy, optimism, fear, loss, and heartbreak. When there is nothing we can’t answer with love and connection, we have a safety that can’t be taken away by the external forces of the world. It won’t keep us from loss, but it will let us feel held and supported inside what cannot be made right.
  The real cutting edge of growth and development is in *hurting with each other*. It’s in companionship, not correction. Acknowledgment—being seen and heard and witnessed inside the truth about one’s own life—is the only real medicine of grief.

- The way to live inside of grief is not by removing pain, but by doing what we can to reduce suffering. Knowing the difference between pain and suffering can help you understand what things *can* be changed and what things simply need your love and attention.
  Being allowed to tend to your grief, without feeling like you need to fix it or clean it up, makes grief, itself, easier. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gngfh0947e3xdbft7z5gsw1d))
- “This is the recurring theme: Quick! She’s in pain! Let’s talk her out of it. Let’s tell her things will be better someday. Let’s remind her to be grateful for what she had. Let’s tell her how smart and funny and kind she is. And let’s be sure, because we know it’s weighing her down, to reassure her that someone other than the man she loves will eventually be beside her, snoring softly, waking up to kiss her good morning, rolling back over to have five more minutes while she gets up to walk the dog so he can sleep. Great. Bring it on. Thanks so much for your kind words. You’ve really relieved my suffering, with all this trying to talk me out of it.
  The people I love, the ones I will go to again and again, are the ones who do not in any way try to “solve” this for me, or fix it, or fix me. They do not make any attempt to cheer me up, or shame me into feeling thankful that I had as much love as I did, and so should be happy with that. They do not tell me things will be better “later,” and that I have so much to live for. They do not remind me I am part of the cycle of life. As though that matters, all that pandering, condescending crap. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gngfhtsfykdcf2chj1g25e0a))
- In his book *The Body Keeps the Score*, Bessel van der Kolk writes that the body needs to express itself when exposed to stimuli. It *has* to. It needs to. When the body and mind experience pain, we have a biological need to express it. Pain that is not allowed to be spoken or expressed turns in on itself, and creates more problems.
  Unacknowledged and unheard pain doesn’t go away. One of the reasons our culture is so messed up around grief is that we’ve tried to erase pain before it’s had its say. We’ve got an emotional backlog sitting in our hearts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gngfm3bdvf3rc4v4y18ghagp))
- For our purposes here, it’s useful to separate pain and suffering. Pain is pure and needs support rather than solutions, but suffering is different. Suffering *can* be fixed, or at least significantly reduced. To differentiate the two, we need to define some terms.
  There are teachings on suffering in a lot of different traditions, both secular and religious. No discussion of pain and suffering, for me, can happen without at least a nod to Buddhism and its language of suffering.
  When we say that the Buddha taught, “All life is suffering, and the way to escape suffering is to embrace impermanence,” he wasn’t saying, “Please pretend you see no suffering; please pretend you aren’t in pain.” He wasn’t saying, “If you’d just let go of your attachments, nothing would hurt.” He saw suffering. He saw pain. He wanted to find a way to stay present and respond. To respond without flinching. Without turning away from the abyss of pain present in the world.
  The Buddha saw pain. He asked: “What can I do to not lose my mind and my heart, here? How can I keep both eyes and heart open without being consumed by this? How can I keep my gaze steady on that which cannot be fixed?”
  His response—in my mind anyway—was love. Love with open hands, with an open heart, knowing that what is given to you will die. It will change. Love anyway. You will witness incredible pain in this life. Love anyway. Find a way to live here, beside that knowledge. Include that knowledge. Love through that. Be willing to not turn away from the pain of this world—pain in yourself or in others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gngfp176raycr7vkrb2q0qaa))
- As we’ve said, pain is a healthy, normal response when someone you love is torn from your life. It hurts, but that doesn’t make pain *wrong*.
  Suffering comes when we feel dismissed or unsupported in our pain, and when we thrash around inside our pain, questioning our choices, our “normalcy,” our actions and reactions.
  Suffering comes with being told to not feel what you feel. Suffering comes with being told there is something wrong with what you feel. Suffering comes with all the crap that gets loaded on us by friends and colleagues and random strangers who, with the best of intentions, correct, judge, or give advice on how we need to grieve better. Suffering also comes when we don’t eat, don’t get enough sleep, spend too much time with toxic people, or pretend we’re not in as much pain as we’re in. Suffering comes when we rehash the events that led up to this death or this loss, punishing ourselves for not preventing it, not knowing more, not doing more. Suffering brings with it anxiety, and fear, and isolation.
  If we want to make this better for you, your *suffering* is where we need to look for change. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gngfqm6m1h8mwhw66exf9at5))
