- Whatever the context, boundaries are about freedom, self-control, responsibility, and love. At the same time, freedom should never be used to harm yourself or anyone else. We are called to be free, but with this caution: “Do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love” (Gal. 5:13). This is the principle. You are free, and your boundaries are meant to protect that freedom. But do not use your freedom to hurt yourself or anyone else. Use your freedom to love. And that brings us to boundaries and your use of technology. You are certainly free to use it, but you must not allow freedom to bring about destruction to you or anyone else. This is what boundaries are for: to keep the good in your life and the bad out of your life. ([Location 3807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=3807))
- Adhering to structures, boundaries, or rules can be very beneficial. But rules in and of themselves should not be your master, robbing you of the freedom to do good for others or yourself. That is why I like to say it this way: Find the misery and make a rule.1 If there is an area of life in which you are suffering, make a personal rule to keep it from hurting you. ([Location 3823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=3823))
- In my own life, I (Henry) found early on that I was allowing work-related email and writing books to intrude too much into personal and family time. So I made a rule: no work email at night, and no writing at home. Another rule we have at home: no use of cell phones or other devices by anyone during family dinners. Why? We are trying to preserve that time and space for family connectedness. Do I occasionally take a call, send a message, or look something up? Of course. At that point, I “heal on the Sabbath.” But as a general rule, no. ([Location 3829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=3829))
- Whatever the particular substance or activity might be, the main principle is this: using that substance or engaging in that activity gives the reward centers in the brain a jolt, or reduces anxiety for a moment, thus reinforcing the use of the substance or behavior. And with chemical substances, as people continue to use their substance of choice, they develop tolerance, meaning they need increasing amounts of it to produce the same result. When not using the substance, they experience withdrawal symptoms, physical and emotional reactions that might range from irritability, chills, and loss of appetite, to vomiting, insomnia, and panic. That’s real addiction. And some people feel other consequences when not engaging in certain compulsive acting out behaviors as well.

- And I want you to have a lot of freedom. In fact, I want you to understand something: the last thing I want to do is to control you. Instead, I want you to be in control of yourselves. I do not want to always have to be looking over your shoulders monitoring or restricting your behavior. But somebody has to do that, and I want it to be the only one who can actually control your behavior, and that is you. So you do not have to fear that I am going to be an overcontrolling, psycho parent. I look forward to your freedom. I welcome it. But . . . here is how freedom works. You get as much as you can be responsible with and are able to use well. I am going to give you a formula to help you figure this out: Freedom = Responsibility = Love ([Location 3908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=3908))
- People whose time is out of control inconvenience others whether they mean to or not. The problem often stems from one or more of the following causes: 1. Omnipotence. These people have unrealistic, somewhat grandiose expectations of what they can accomplish in a given amount of time. “No problem—I’ll do it” is their motto. 2. Overresponsibility for the feelings of others. They think that leaving a party too early will insult the host. 3. Lack of realistic anxiety. They live so much in the present that they neglect to plan ahead for traffic, parking the car, or dressing for an outing. ([Location 4259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=4259))
- They can be a curse when we use them to do the following:         •  Hide from intimacy by talking nonstop         •  Dominate conversations to control others         •  Gossip         •  Make sarcastic remarks, expressing indirect hostility         •  Threaten someone, expressing direct hostility         •  Gain approval through flattery         •  Give the silent treatment (withholding words to punish someone)         •  Massage the truth in order to look better         •  Seduce or manipulate Many people who have difficulty setting verbal boundaries on themselves aren’t really aware of their problem. They are often genuinely surprised when a friend says to them, “Sometimes it seems like you interpret my commas as periods.” ([Location 4299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=4299))
- The Scriptures tell us to treat our words carefully: “Too much talk leads to sin. Be sensible and keep your mouth shut” (Prov. 10:19 NLT). “The one who has knowledge uses words with restraint” (Prov. 17:27). According to Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament, the Hebrew word for “restrain” refers to “the free action of holding back something or someone. The actor has the power over the object.”1 It’s a boundary-laden term. We have the power to set boundaries on what comes out of our mouths. ([Location 4317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=4317))
- Why doesn’t our no work on ourselves? There are at least three reasons for this. 1. We are our own worst enemies. An external problem is easier to deal with than an internal one. When we switch our focus from setting limits on other people to setting limits on ourselves, we make a major shift in responsibility. Previously, we were only responsible to, not for, the other party. Now we have a great deal more involvement—we are the other party. We are responsible for ourselves. When you are around a critical person, the kind who finds fault with everything, you can set limits on your exposure to this person’s constant criticism. You can change subjects, rooms, houses, or continents. You can leave. But what if this critical person is in your own head? What if you are the person with the problem? What if you have met the enemy, and the enemy is you? 2. We withdraw from relationship when we most need it. ([Location 4348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=4348))
- the more we isolate ourselves, the harder our struggle becomes. Just like an untreated cancer can become life-threatening in a short time, self-boundary problems will worsen with increased aloneness. ([Location 4382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=4382))
- The willpower approach is simple. Whatever the problem behavior is, just stop doing it. In other words, “just say no.” Imperatives such as “Choose to stop,” “Decide to say no,” and “Make a commitment never to do it again” abound in this approach. The problem with this approach is that it makes an idol out of the will, something God never intended. Just as our hearts and minds are distorted by the fall, so is our power to make right decisions. Will is only strengthened by relationship; we can’t make commitments alone. God told Moses to encourage and strengthen Joshua (Deut. 3:28); he didn’t tell Moses to tell Joshua to “just say no.” If we depend on willpower alone, we are guaranteed to fail. We are denying the power of the relationship promised in the cross. If all we need is our will to overcome evil, we certainly don’t need a Savior (1 Cor. 1:17). The truth is, willpower alone is useless against self-boundary struggles: ([Location 4392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=4392))
- What are the roots? Identifying the causes of your self-boundary problems will assist you in understanding your own contribution to the problem (how you have failed or sinned), your developmental injuries (how you have been sinned against), and the significant relationships that may have contributed to the problem. Some possible roots of self-boundary conflicts include these:         •  Lack of training. Some people never learned to accept limits, to pay the consequences of their actions, or to delay gratification when they were growing up. For example, they may never have experienced any consequences for dawdling as a child.         •  Rewarded destructiveness. People who come from families in which the mom or dad was an alcoholic may have learned that out-of-control behavior brings relationship. The family came together when the alcoholic member drank.         •  Distorted need. Some boundary problems are legitimate, God-given needs in disguise. God gave us sexual desire both to reproduce ourselves and to enjoy our spouses. Those suffering a pornography addiction have diverted this good desire; they feel real and alive only when acting out sexually.

- Unmet emotional hungers. We all need love during the first few years of life. If we don’t receive this love, we hunger for it for the rest of our lives. This hunger for love is so powerful that when we don’t find it in relationships with other people, we look for it in other places, such as in food, in work, in sexual activity, or in spending money. ([Location 4431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=4431))
- Covering emotional hurt. People who are injured emotionally, who were neglected or abused as children, disguise their pain by overeating, drinking too much, or working too much. They may abuse substances to distract from the real pain of being unloved, unwanted, and alone. If they were to stop using these disguises, their isolation would be intolerable. ([Location 4438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=4438))
- Listen to empathic feedback from others. As you fail in setting boundaries on yourself, you need others who will let you know about it in a caring way. Many times you are unaware of your own failures. Sometimes you may not truly understand the extent of the damage your lack of boundaries causes in the lives of those you care about. Other believers can provide perspective and support. ([Location 4482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=4482))
- Welcome consequences as your teacher. Learning about sowing and reaping is valuable. It teaches us that we suffer losses when we aren’t responsible. The compulsive overeater has medical and social difficulties. The overspender faces bankruptcy court. The chronically late person misses plane flights and important meetings, and loses friendships. The procrastinator faces losses of promotions and bonuses. And on and on. We need to enter God’s training school of learning to suffer for our irresponsibility. Not all suffering should be embraced;2 however, when our own lack of love or responsibility causes the suffering, pain becomes our teacher. Learning how to develop better self-boundaries is an orderly process. First, we are confronted about the destructiveness of our behavior by others. Then consequences will follow if we don’t heed the feedback. Words precede actions and give us a chance to turn from our destructiveness before we have to suffer. God doesn’t glory in our suffering. Just as a loving father’s heart breaks when he sees his children in pain, God wants to spare us pain. But when his words and the feedback of his other children don’t reach us, consequences are the only way to keep us from further damage. God is like the parent who warns his teenager that drinking will cause a loss of car privileges. First, the warning: “Stop drinking now. It will have bad consequences for you.” Then, if it’s not heeded, car privileges are yanked. This painful consequence prevents a possible serious catastrophe: a drunk-driving accident.

- Another injury due to victimization is a deep, pervasive sense of being “all-bad,” wrong, dirty, or shameful. No matter how affirming others are of their lovableness and their attributes, victims are convinced that underneath it all, they have no good inside themselves. Because of the severity of their injuries, many victims have overpermeable boundaries. They take on badness that isn’t theirs. They begin believing that the way they were treated is the way they should be treated. Many victims think that, since they were told they were bad or evil thousands of times, it certainly must be true. ([Location 4568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=4568))
- The driving force behind boundaries has to be desire. We usually know what is the right thing to do in life, but we are rarely motivated to do it unless there’s a good reason. That we should be obedient to God, who tells us to set and maintain boundaries, is certainly the best reason. But sometimes we need a more compelling reason than obedience. We need to see that what is right is also good for us. And we usually only see these good reasons when we’re in pain. Our pain motivates us to act. Even with the desire for a better life, we can be reluctant to do the work of boundaries for another reason: it will be a war. There will be skirmishes and battles. There will be disputes. There will be losses. ([Location 4714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=4714))
- Angry people have a character problem. If you reinforce this character problem, it will return tomorrow and the next day in other situations. It is not the situation that’s making them angry, but the feeling that they are entitled to things from others. They want to control others, and as a result, they have no control over themselves. So when they lose their wished-for control over someone, they “lose it.” They get angry. The first thing you need to learn is that the person who is angry at you for setting boundaries is the one with the problem. If you do not realize this, you may think you have a problem. Maintaining your boundaries is good for other people; it will help them learn what their families of origin did not teach them: to respect other people. Second, you must view anger realistically. Anger is only a feeling inside the other person. It cannot jump across the room and hurt you. It cannot “get inside” you unless you allow it. Staying separate from another’s anger is vitally important. Let the anger be in the other person. He will have to feel his anger to get better. If you either rescue him from it or take it on yourself, the angry person will not get better and you will be in bondage. Third, do not let anger be a cue for you to do something. People without boundaries respond automatically to the anger of others. They rescue, seek approval, or get angry themselves. There is great power in inactivity. Do not let an out-of-control person be the cue for you to change your course. Just allow him to be angry, and decide for yourself what you need to do. Fourth, make sure you have your support system in place. If you are going to set some limits with a person who has controlled you with anger, talk to the people in your support system first and make a plan. Know what you will say. Anticipate what the angry person will say, and plan your reaction. You may even want to role-play the situation with your group. Then make sure your support group will be available to you right after the confrontation. Perhaps some members of your support group can go with you. But certainly you will need them afterward to keep you from crumbling under the pressure. ([Location 4755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XFKNB2Y&location=4755))
