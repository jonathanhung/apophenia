- Which women do you want to meet and what kind of relationship do you want to have with them?
  Context. Whether you chat a woman up in a coffee shop, introduce yourself at a business networking event, or attend a speed dating event is going to make a huge difference.
  This question of where and in what context you meet women is what I call demographics, and it is by-and-large ignored by pretty much all dating advice out there today. This absolutely boggles my mind since social interactions are always contextual, and therefore, attracting women is always contextual.

- Now, it’s true that if John practiced and perfected his use of lines and tactics, he may be able to convince Jenna in the short-term that he’s less invested and is actually in her demographic (vague stories about his stripper ex-girlfriends and the like), but hopefully by now you realize how badly these kinds of strategies backfire, particularly in the long run. Eventually, John’s lines will run out and like Cinderella after the ball, Jenna will be horrified at who she’s actually talking to.
  But because John (and Jenna) worked on themselves, broadened their demographics, enriched their lifestyles, and lived their lives in ways that were more in line with what they wanted, they came to find enough common ground to be attracted to one another.
  This is the power of demographics.
  And notice it has little to do with the people themselves — whether or not they’re attracted to each other — but more to do with timing. Two years prior they were not compatible. Two years later, they are. Remember, right person, wrong time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnghc1jtxz314j70818r8gge))
- If she values expressing her emotions openly and what her friends think of her, and you value serious conversation, intellectual pursuits and don’t care much for social gatherings, there’s going to be a large amount of friction from the get-go.
  This is unavoidable. Clever lines won’t change it. Being good-looking won’t change it. Being rich won’t change it. If you hate what she loves and she hates what you love, it’s not going to go anywhere. Period.
  The answer isn’t replacing your identity and passions; the answer is to expand your identity and passions. Expand it to include new and interesting activities, new modes of expression, and new ways of presenting yourself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnghcrq393rgvg7qb2k2bvm2))
- What I recommend to every man before he even begins talking to women is to sit down for a while and ask himself a few questions:
  > - What do you value in a woman? Honesty? Beauty? Affection? Intelligence? Curiosity? Similar interests? Education? Obviously, the answer is “all of the above”, right? So let me rephrase the question: what do you value the most? What is an absolute deal-breaker in the women you date? Prioritize what you look for in a woman. This will help you decide where to look.
  > - Women with the traits that you value, where do they frequent? Where are you most likely to find them?
  > - What do you enjoy doing most? Do you love to read/write? Do you play music? Do you enjoy sports and competitions? What are the events or organizations that you can become involved in that explore your hobbies?
  > - If you don’t know what your passions and interests are, take a minute and write down things that you’ve always wanted to do but have never had the time or never worked up the nerve to do. Make a promise to yourself to get involved in that activity or event in some way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnghet70zrgjct01h8y3wqdp))
- Becoming a non-needy man requires, first and foremost, a high level of honesty with yourself. Part of that honesty with yourself involves observing and challenging your own beliefs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnghneb70w181g9h00syqb48))
- anyone can be handsome and appear high-status if they put enough effort into it. So no excuses.
  And of course, status is ultimately determined by demographics. At a college house party, a burly 20-year-old kid who crushes beer cans on his head is going to have a high level of status to the girls there. At an opening at a local art gallery, he is going to have almost none. A skinny bass-playing hipster is going to have high status at a local indie show and low status at a business-networking event. A successful stock trader who wears Armani suits is going to have high status at his firm’s annual Christmas party and little status at a hippy music festival.
  It’s all relative. The key is to 1) recognize your personal interests and strengths, and 2) build upon those personal interests and strengths to quickly attract women in your preferred demographic. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnghtgx5j2ycnf7gk6pqp6vh))
- Part of living the honest lifestyle is to pursue what you’re passionate about to the fullest extent. If you absolutely love visiting art exhibitions, don’t just visit a bunch of art exhibitions, but take an active role in the organization, start a meet up group to find other people who want to visit them, or create a forum for commentary. Don’t just pursue your interests, become a leader in your interests. Don’t just choose a demographic of women to meet, dominate the demographic.

- eing Something Versus Saying Something
  If there’s one takeaway from this chapter, it’s that it is far more powerful to be something attractive rather than to say something attractive. You can say the most attractive sentence in the world, but if it isn’t backed up by who you are, then it’s not going to have any meaning. Whereas if you are something amazing, then anything you say will be attractive because it will be coming from a genuinely attractive man.
  Women are attracted to your identity. Words mean nothing. What you say is only a means to buy you enough time to show her that identity. Notice I said “show her” not “tell her.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnghweg7bqgyfcgyrg51ezsq))
- This is why trying to impress women by flaunting an image of what you think is attractive will always backfire. Men can go out and perform as much as they want — for weeks, months, or even years — and they’ll never get good results because they’re not portraying themselves well. They don’t have a clear and successful identity. They aren’t in touch with the way in which they’re living their lives.
  When you’re like this man – when you’re focused so much on performing rather than actually being – then you are out of touch with your identity, who you are, and what you want. And when you’re out of touch with yourself, you will fall into the abyss of vague and empty demographics. You will aimlessly claw for whatever woman comes near you. You will be left bewildered at how you seem unable to polarize anyone.
  Discovering your truth and establishing your identity is necessary to determine the demographics of women you desire and the demographics of women you appeal to. And, as we’ll see, working your demographics underlies everything else in dating. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gngj1gqdfxxbvd1vfzzwdxwn))
- Developing Character
  One thing that consistently holds men back is that they come across as just another typical dude or bro. Dime a dozen. We’re pressured most of our lives to go with the flow, go along with what our friends like and just agree with what those around us think.
  As we’ve discussed, this is unattractive behavior because it demonstrates a lack of investment in your own interests, passions, and desires. Attractive men are polarizing and uninhibited. Attractive men make their opinions known. They’ve had unique experiences and ideas. They’ve tried things many people haven’t tried, done things many people haven’t done, and share their ideas openly and freely.
  Put another way, an attractive man with depth and character is a man who has opinions and openly expresses those opinions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gngj5r80xkvb3n0fb52e079m))
- Ask yourself this: If you were lined up next to 10 random, single men from your town, what would make you stand out from them? Imagine a woman met all 10 of you in a row. What is there about you that would stop her dead in her tracks and make her say, "Wow, this man is unique?" What do you have that they don’t? What can you offer that most other men can’t?
  Do you secretly write poetry in your spare time and hide it in your closet? Have you been skydiving three times? Did you climb a glacier in the Alps once? Have you tried eating things like snakes, worms, spiders? What have you done that’s cool and interesting and has shaped you as a person?
  What are your rough edges that people can’t find anywhere else? What have you done that will make you stand out in her mind? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gngj8vxm7pt8ae60tsmkfsk1))
- Developing an attractive lifestyle is a long-term process. It requires a consistent and penetrating look at your actions, your habits and what you’ve chosen to do with most of your time.
  Your job, your hobbies, your friends, your interests, are these things mostly a result of what was told to you or pushed on you, or are they things that you consciously evaluated and chose based on how enriching and passionate they made you feel?

- Let’s be honest, we all pass up dozens of situations like the above on a weekly basis, no matter how experienced or inexperienced we are. We’ve all let hundreds, if not thousands of opportunities go, usually without a thought or even realizing it. We’ve all done it. And we’ll all continue to do it.
  So I’m not here to rail on you to stop passing up opportunities. You already know the opportunities you pass up. And I’m sure by now you’ve had more than your fill of woulda-coulda-shoulda moments.
  I’m more interested in the stories you tell yourself. The stories that we all tell ourselves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gngjhj0n2hkj3bsjj33913zm))
- Women communicate more in feelings and, more specifically, through intentions. Sure, they still pay attention to the facts and stories on the surface, but what’s actually communicated to them is the intention and feeling underneath. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnpwjq20ychbw40cg3cva94f))
- Some dating advice tells men not to compliment a woman too early or too often. The reason for this is that most men who read dating advice have poor intentions: they’re needy and looking to validate themselves through sex or female affection. So when a man compliments a woman out of neediness, it’s going to make a woman feel uncomfortable and objectified.
  Now if a man compliments a woman out of genuine appreciation for her, she’s going to hear his intention and be genuinely appreciative of him as well.
  Teasing and flirting with women is another great example. Many men, when they first begin trying to flirt with women, will tease them or “neg” them. Ask yourself this, what’s the difference between a tease and an insult? Both are derogatory statements. Both often incorporate humor. So what’s the difference?
  Intention. Teasing is done with a fun and positive intention. Insults are done with a negative intention.
  Or what’s the difference between sharing yourself and bragging? Let’s say you are friends with a celebrity. What’s the difference between sharing your life experience with a woman (attractive) and bragging to her (unattractive)?
  Hopefully, you’re catching on by now: it’s intention. What is your intention? Are you trying to impress her (needy) and therefore bragging? Or are you sharing yourself (vulnerability) and therefore polarizing her? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnpwsxevqfnwtt26yevw1rrt))
- Creepiness is behaving in a way that makes a woman feel insecure sexually.
  The further you get out of line with your intentions, the more distrustful she will be of your actions and words. And the more distrustful she is, the more insecure she will feel and the creepier you become. For instance, if you approach a woman and stand there and talk about the weather, but you’re staring at her rack the whole time while licking your lips, then you will come across as creepy. Your actions and words are completely out of line with your intentions and she can see that.
  Even if you tell her honestly, “You have great tits,” you will be creepy. Not for lack of intention, but because she doesn’t know you and most women are not comfortable being sexual around men they don’t know. Trust takes time. She has to see that your actions line up with your intentions before she can feel comfortable exposing herself to you and making herself vulnerable.
  Women have a lot more to lose from expressing their sexuality than men do. They make babies. We don’t. They get raped and/or sexually assaulted at a startlingly high rate. We don’t. They have five thousands years of sexist cultural history making them feel like a slut. We don’t.
  The second you make them feel uncomfortable sexually is the second you become a creep and the second she’s finding an excuse to get away from you as fast as she can.
  This is why vulnerability is so huge. When you’re vulnerable around someone you don’t know, it elicits trust in them and they will become more vulnerable toward you in return. The more vulnerable a woman is willing to be around you, the less likely you will be to creep her out.
  (Caveat 1: Vulnerability is still subject to the right intentions. If you tell a girl a sob story for no other reason than to get her to feel sorry for you and sleep with you, then guess what, you’re still creepy!) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnpwxxy60bj10fd6kky67m23))
