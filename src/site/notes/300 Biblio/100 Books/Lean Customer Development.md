- Customer development starts with a shift in mind-set. Instead of assuming that your ideas and intuitions are correct and embarking on product development, you will be actively trying to poke holes in your ideas, to prove yourself wrong, and to invalidate your hypotheses.

- If you’ve ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=326))
- done customer development alongside product development, you don’t need to wait until your product is launched to know whether customers will buy. You’ll know, because you will already have beta customers, evangelists, and paying customers. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=326))
- To get that foundation in place, I want you and your team to do three exercises that will take less than an hour total to complete (Figure 2-1): Identify your assumptions Write your problem hypothesis Map your target customer profile I recommend these three exercises because it’s fairly easy to get your team members to participate regardless of whether they embrace customer development or are actively skeptical. It’s hard to argue with “Let’s make sure everyone understands what we’re trying to achieve and how.” ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=531))
- You need to find and focus on those day one people, found on the left side of the innovation adoption lifecycle (Figure 2-3 ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=641))
- What will help you build an amazing product starts with highly specific, detailed, and passionate information — in small amounts. ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=688))
- Running Lean, ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=705))
- Individuals are different, but human psychology is pretty universal. We’re all motivated by the same desires: We like to help others We like to sound smart ([Location 781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=781))
- We like to fix things ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=782))
- by pursuing a complaint successfully we can demonstrate our influence in our relationships and/or our social context and feel more capable, competent and empowered.[19] ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=808))
- While you may already know some prospective customers, it’s more likely that you’ll find people within the larger universe of second-degree connections. You’ll need to ask your connections to introduce you to their friends, coworkers, and family members who have the problem that you’re trying to solve. ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=836))
- In-person interviews at a neutral location work well for: Interviews where you wish to speak with two or more people together, but want to avoid having any of them be distracted by family members or coworkers (such as spouses or business partners) Consumer products where the audience is general enough that you can try to string together back-to-back interviews in a Starbucks or another public place ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=1076))
- Thank you for your willingness to help me out! I’d like to schedule a 20-minute call so I can learn from you. You don’t need to prepare in advance; just hearing about your experiences with ________, from your personal perspective, will be a huge help to me. Does one of these times work for you?

- Find the people whose problem is most severe; they are eager to solve it and may become earlyvangelists. People will talk to you because we all like to help others, like to sound smart, like to fix things, and like to complain. Ask connections to introduce you to their friends. Explain why you’re asking them in particular. ([Location 1215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=1215))
- Spend time understanding all aspects of the customer value proposition. Ask yourself: why should your customer buy your product? How does your product fit into the rest of his world? What influences his opinion of the product’s value? What is your product displacing — all products displace something — and why your customer should risk making that switch? ([Location 1270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=1270))
- Customers know what they’ve tried in the past that hasn’t worked, but they won’t remember to tell you about it. ([Location 1325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=1325))

- What You Should Be Listening For To get the most out of the five basic customer development questions, you’ll want to know what to listen for. These are the objective and subjective factors that separate prospective customers from buying customers: How your customers are behaving today (which predicts how they’ll behave tomorrow) The constraints that affect the choices and actions that your customers take What frustrates or motivates your customers How your customers make decisions, spend money, and determine value ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=1368))
- “A single pivot wasn’t enough; the interface still wasn’t correct enough. ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=1390))
- You won’t get it right on the first try. That’s the thing to remember when you find yourself tempted to skip interviews and just build something. For many teams, you may be able to build a quick version in a day or two. ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07582F7BB&location=1393))
- Discovering what your customer is doing today is the heart of understanding the problem that you’re setting out to solve. What your customers are doing today tells you: What they are capable of doing What they are comfortable with doing (and why) Which decisions they are making Their current behavior is your competition. It doesn’t matter how effective or ineffective their current behavior seems — it’s what they are accustomed to and it works (at least to some degree).
