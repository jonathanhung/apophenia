- Klein and Wolf (1998) explore a different definition of leverage points in the context of sensemaking and AI research: “the application of experience to detect fruitful starting points in the construction of novel courses of action” (p. 158).3 This framing reinterprets the core metaphor of leverage points not as fulcra where changemakers will place levers but as holds, they use to grasp strategic options when rock climbing. Holds, they say, are not context-free features: they are dependent on the climber (their size, their skill), the rock (the crevices and cracks available), the environment (how wet or dark it may be), and the interaction between these actors. Thus, identifying leverage points is a skill that benefits expertise and experience with a system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtz2e5jc7q365jm33wn3tya))
- for the prescriptive use of some of her ideas, Meadows relies on non-actionable metaphysics. In her discussion of systems goals, for example, she writes, “I have watched in wonder as a new leader in an organization comes in, enunciates a new goal, and swings hundreds or thousands or millions of perfectly intelligent, rational people off in a new direction” (p. 18). She offers no prescription for how systemic changemakers might do this themselves. Granted, perhaps this is meant to be the domains of leadership scholars, where theories such as post-industrial leadership (Rost, 1993), the social change model of leadership (Komives & Wagner, 2016), transformational leadership (Bass & Riggio, 2006), or system leadership (Senge et al., 2015) might be better suited to explain these capabilities.

- Again, it may not have been her responsibility to tell readers how exactly to understand how to transcend paradigms, but it is the responsibility of a modern theory of leverage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtytdy0azxbpkd9kpvf3a35))
