- Sexual harassment, like most sexual conduct, is extremely dangerous as a public issue. A public issue, properly speaking, can only be an issue about which the public can confidently know. Because most sexual conduct is private, occurring only between two people, there are typically no witnesses. Apart from the possibility of a confession, the public can know about it only as a probably unjudgeable contest of stories. (In those rare instances when a sexual offense occurs before reliable witnesses, then, of course, it is a legitimate public issue.)
  Does this mean that sexual conduct is *only* private in its interest and meaning? It certainly does not. For if there is no satisfactory way to deal publicly with sexual issues, there is also no satisfactory way to deal with them in mere privacy. To make sense of sexual issues or of sex itself, a third term, a third entity, has to intervene between public and private. For sex is not and cannot be any individual’s “own business,” nor is it merely the private concern of any couple. Sex, like any other necessary, precious, and volatile power that is commonly held, is everybody’s business. A way must be found to entitle everybody’s legitimate interest in it without either violating its essential privacy or allowing its unrestrained energies to reduce necessary public procedures to the level of a private quarrel.

- Science is an enterprise of materiality, dealing in empirical proofs, in the tangible, the measurable, and the countable. And so, in terms of procedure, there can be no objection to Mr. Wilson’s materialism; he is a scientist, and from a scientist we require truths that are materially verifiable. But as a doctrine of belief, materialism takes him into several kinds of trouble. These troubles show up pretty plainly against his obviously genuine concern for conservation of the natural world.
  A minor problem, perhaps, is the tendency of materialism to objectify the world, dividing it from the “objective observer” who studies it. The world thus becomes “the environment,” a word which Mr. Wilson uses repeatedly when speaking of conservation, and which means “surroundings,” a place that one is *in* but not *of*.

- The first law of such an economy would be what the agriculturalist Sir Albert Howard called “the law of return.” This law requires that what is taken from nature must be given back: The fertility cycle must be maintained in continuous rotation. The primary value in this economy would be the capacity of the natural and cultural systems to renew themselves. An authentic economy would be based upon renewable resources: land, water, ecological health. These resources, if they are to stay renewable in human use, will depend upon resources of culture that also must be kept renewable: accurate local memory, truthful accounting, continuous maintenance, un-wastefulness, and a democratic distribution of now-rare practical arts and skills.
