- No one hungers for male love more than the little girl or boy who rightfully needs and seeks love from Dad. He may be absent, dead, present in body yet emotionally not there, but the girl or boy hungers to be acknowledged, recognized, respected, cared for. All around our nation a billboard carries this message: “Each night millions of kids go to sleep starving—for attention from their dads.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7wg0f0kwf9v6h0atr7gfn1))

    - Note: this one i feel; but its also expressed in non-romantic ways for me at least. kinda in the greco-roman "forms of love". i do lust for male bodies at rare times but also want spiritual friendships, emotional intimacy, intense shared experiences with my male friends.

- As a child I hungered for the love of my dad. I wanted him to notice me, to give me his attention and his affections. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7wnyvcht40txsw16tseekd))
    - Note: I want my dad to be proud of me. I think about the early times of having less IQ than I thought I had; the shame of being less than "highly gifted". The desire to be special. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Feminist writing did not tell us about the deep inner misery of men. It did not tell us the terrible terror that gnaws at the soul when one cannot love. Women who envied men their hardheartedness were not about to tell us the depth of male suffering. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7wsvbbfxt447mcxegvt763))
- The truth we do not tell is that men are longing for love. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7wyfb92yxhfg4bkmz0ag13))
- In part, I began to write books about love because of the constant fighting between my ex-boyfriend Anthony and myself. We were (and at the time of this writing still are) each other’s primary bond. We came together hoping to create love and found ourselves creating conflict. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7wzdqzbxd6rfpasncdez2a))
- The unhappiness of men in relationships, the grief men feel about the failure of love, often goes unnoticed in our society precisely because the patriarchal culture really does not care if men are unhappy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7x3972hcf2a0dvc6crzmxg))
- Patriarchal mores teach a form of emotional stoicism to men that says they are more manly if they do not feel, but if by chance they should feel and the feelings hurt, the manly response is to stuff them down, to forget about them, to hope they go away ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7x4x5w60xfwqasw27geesz))
- George Weinberg explains in Why Men Won’t Commit: “Most men are on quest for the ready-made perfect woman because they basically feel that problems in a relationship can’t be worked out. When the slightest thing goes wrong, it seems easier to bolt than talk.” The masculine pretense is that real men feel no pain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7x4jek9w5whfphb60dqr83))
    - Note: Is the modern male obsession with stoicism just patriarchy in another form? Does bell hooks misunderstand stoicism? [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- If we cannot heal what we cannot feel, by supporting patriarchal culture that socializes men to deny feelings, we doom them to live in states of emotional numbness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7x9q1ebaa5t1ms8rwh6hve))

- He may apologize and feel shame immediately after, but he can’t sustain that emotion; it’s too painful, too reminiscent of hurts long buried. So he blames it on her. If it happens repeatedly with more than one woman, he goes from blaming her to blaming “them.” His personal shortcomings become rationalized by an evolving misogyny…. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpctk38mkq0jm66zs21hj6j))
- Often men who have been emotionally neglected and abused as children by dominating mothers bond with assertive women, only to have their childhood feelings of being engulfed surface ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpcw387r6sqyjj2abygwjs9))
- As it is for many men today, it was much easier for him to accept equal pay for equal work, sharing housework, and reproductive rights than it was for him to accept the need for shared emotional development. It is more difficult for men to do the work of emotional development because this work requires individuals to be emotionally aware—to feel ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpcyjajrvx63ztyd26fcce3))
- Conservative mass media offer daily lessons in patriarchal pedagogy; they tell boys what they must do to be men. In those homes where enlightened fathers daily work to repudiate violence, television reaffirms its importance, making courting death glamorous and sexy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpd0fkq65edyyhj4cnpvka4))
- Men who win on patriarchal terms end up losing in terms of their substantive quality of life. They choose patriarchal manhood over loving connection, first foregoing self-love and then the love they could give and receive that would connect them to others ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpd8r100nr46jkzpqt5hw9r))
- Rage is the easy way back to a realm of feeling. It can serve as the perfect cover, masking feelings of fear and failure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpjcqr35ga31tmdepzv7s6x))
- The threat of violence, of emotional abuse, is always there, standing in the way of intimacy, keeping them from forgiving one another and starting over. Sadly, they are stuck in the trap of patriarchy. And it remains the breeding ground for everyday violence, the subtle, intimate terrorism that intensifies resentment and closes off the possibility of knowing joy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpkpafzjhnzctswt0da4jgv))
- women’s liberation seemed to promise heterosexual and bisexual men that women would begin to think the same way males do about sexuality, that female sexuality would become just as predatory, just as obsessive as male sexual desire. Lots of men thought this was the promise of paradise. Finally they were going to be able to go for the sexual gusto without having to worry about commitment. Sexist logic had convinced them and convinces them still that they can have connection and intimacy without commitment, that “Have dick will travel” meant that their needs could and would be met on command, at any time, anywhere ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggne9jmz1zq3fad9kjtrw3gg))
- Again and again children hear the message from mass media that when it comes to sex, “he’s gotta have it.” Adults may know better, from their own experience, but children become true believers. They think that men will go mad if they cannot act sexually. This is the logic that produces what feminist thinkers call “a rape culture.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggnea23qxm8r8xgeq7x289e2))
- learn early on in life that one of the primary rewards offered to them for obedience to patriarchal thought and practice is the right to dominate females sexually. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggneacq05en3eahzxn6y9msw))
- men who have been victimized by stronger boys, brothers, and other male peers share how the logic of patriarchal thinking about the right of the strong to do as they wish with those whom they deem weak was presented to them by their abusers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggneatemdf8694r7tqrwsvvc))
- Hence the underlying message boys receive about sexual acts is that they will be destroyed if they are not in control, exercising power. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggneq6rtqtqz24n17b6gw4ey))
- Adolescent sexual socialization is the vulnerable moment in a boy’s life when he is required to identify his selfhood and his sexuality with patriarchal masculinity; it is the meeting place of theory and practice. During these formative years, when a boy’s sexual lust is often intense, he learns that patriarchal culture expects him to covertly cultivate that lust and the will to satisfy it while engaging in overt acts of sexual repression. This splitting is part of the initiation into patriarchal masculinity; it is a rite of passage. The boy learns as well that females are the enemy when it comes to the satisfaction of sexual desire. They are the group that will impose on the boy the need to repress his sexual longings, and yet to prove his manhood, he must dare to move past repression and engage in sexual acts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggnec0cjw79kdede7qjkq8pa))
- Sexual pleasure is rarely the goal in a sexual encounter, something far more important than mere pleasure is on the line, our sense of ourselves as men. Men’s sense of sexual scarcity and an almost compulsive need for sex to confirm manhood feed each other, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of sexual deprivation and despair. And it makes men furious at women for doing what women are taught to do in our society: saying no. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggnecwych2jd01echhdhc5q4))
- The more intense the pain of fear, unworthiness, and feeling unlovable becomes, the more obsessive becomes the need to have a sexual interaction.”
  Sex, then, becomes for most men a way of self-solacing. It is not about connecting to someone else but rather about releasing their own pain. The addict is often an individual in acute pain. Patriarchal men have no outlet to express their pain, so they simply seek release. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggnedv8njsnmv7haeeacm6bj))
- Since it is neither possible biologically nor practical, given the few hours in a day available for leisure activity, for men to be in sexual interactions constantly, patriarchal pornography available in myriad forms becomes the site of sublimation, the place where the sexual addict can get a quick fix. Patriarchal men can do pornography anywhere all day long. They can watch movies, look at magazines, look at real females with a pornographic gaze, undress them, fuck them, dominate them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggnem8pp8rgrsnsfy34q1pmr))
- women are the targets for displaced male rage at the failure of patriarchy to make good on its promise of fulfillment, especially endless sexual fulfillment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggnekrtm7nvz2x1ah4a94qtg))
- They are told that money offers fulfillment and that work is a way to acquire money—but not the only way. Winning the lottery, finding a wealthy partner, or committing a crime for which you do not get caught are paths to fulfillment that are as acceptable as working. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7xg5mq21sse2yp28bd6ebe))
- As a primary foundation of patriarchal self-esteem, work has not worked for masses of men for some time. Rather than throw out the whole outmoded patriarchal script so that the nature of work in our culture can be changed, men are offered addictions that make unsatisfying work more bearable. Patriarchal obsession with sex and the pornography it produces are promoted to soothe men subliminally while they perform jobs that are tedious, boring, and oftentimes dehumanizing, jobs where their health and well-being are at risk. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7xh73q26cnwv9anpwj0yxp))
- Work stands in the way of love for most men then because the long hours they work often drain their energies; there is little or no time left for emotional labor, for doing the work of love. The conflict between finding time for work and finding time for love and loved ones is rarely talked about in our nation. It is simply assumed in patriarchal culture that men should be willing to sacrifice meaningful emotional connections to get the job done. No one has really tried to examine what men feel about the loss of time with children, partners, loved ones, and the loss of time for self-development. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7xv62kzqdq49msbxftfjb6))
- Of course they do not critique the economy that makes it necessary for all adults to work outside the home; instead they pretend that feminism keeps women in the workforce. Most women work because they want to leave the house and because their families need the income to survive, not because they are feminists who believe that their working is a sign of liberation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpkzpw7tphn78axzrxrdvx9))
- the vast majority of men still refuse to play an equal role in the emotional development of their children. They often use work as the excuse for emotional estrangement ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpm4kgsqn0anwh051kpw2sk))
- He argues that most men have such a limited sense of self that they are uncertain that they possess “selves we could want to relate to.” He contends, “We only seem to learn that the ‘self’ is something we have to control tightly, since otherwise it might upset our plans…. We never really give ourselves much chance to know ourselves better or develop more contact with ourselves, since…all this threatens the ‘control’ we have been brought up to identify our masculinity with. We feel trapped, though we do not know how we are constantly remaking this trap for ourselves ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghpm7qr4qzsbgvmczp7hx93g))
- These movies seduce audiences with images of men in the process of growing up, but then they betray their characters and us by never letting these men live. They echo the patriarchal message that if a man stops work, he loses his reason for living. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghrz556f6bpggt3hm2cfbqy9))
- In Love and Survival Dean Ornish, sharing his personal struggle to work less, to make time for self-actualization, offers this insight:
  If the intention behind the work is to seek recognition and power—“hey, look at me, I’m special, I’m important, I’m worthy of your love and respect”—then you are setting yourself apart from others as a way of trying to feel connected to them. Setting yourself apart from others as a way of trying to feel connected to them: It seems so clear why this is self-defeating, and yet it is often the norm in our culture…. When my self-worth was defined by what I did, then I had to take every important opportunity that came along, even if relationships suffered. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghrz813w6rwv4ms7aes51tba))
- Courageously writing about how hard it was to break with the patriarchal values that had governed his thinking for years, Ornish shares that the practice of intimacy is healing: “I am learning that the key to our survival is love. When we love someone and feel loved by them, somehow along the way our suffering subsides, our deepest wounds begin healing, our hearts start to feel safe enough to be vulnerable and to open a little wider. We begin experiencing our own emotions and the feelings of those around us ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghrzahxv7bmwpssn0my2ch1b))
- When feminist women told the world that patriarchy promotes woman-hating, the response was that feminists were being too extreme, exaggerating the problem. Yet when men who knew nothing about feminism claimed that feminists were man-hating, there was no response from the nonfeminist world saying that they were being too extreme. No feminists have murdered and raped men. Feminists have not been jailed day after day for their violence against men. No feminists have been accused of ongoing sexual abuse of girl children, including creating a world of child pornography featuring little girls. Yet these are some of the acts of men that led some feminist women to identify men as woman-hating ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghrzzj72n4yvj8cpwegp3dyj))
- To counter patriarchal representations of men as being without feeling, in both the books I write for adults and those I write for children, I have endeavored to create images of men that demonstrate their beauty and integrity of spirit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpvap8dyjwvfvy5pc815k5x))
- poet Robert Bly called on men to find the Wild Man within in hopes that they would in a safe space let their hearts speak, that they would howl, and cry, and dance, and play, and find again the spirit within. Of course men who participated in workshops such as those Bly conducted, let loose for a while and then journeyed back to their patriarchal world, leaving the wild spirit behind ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmpvb9rfg9jgmdtr63w38wqd))
- Many mothers in patriarchal culture express their rage at adult men by directing anger at their sons.

- Broken emotional bonds with mothers and fathers, the traumas of emotional neglect and abandonment that so many males have experienced and been unable to name, have damaged and wounded the spirits of men.
