## Highlights

- In this new era, you have two choices: become a temp staffer (not a horrible choice) or become an artist-entrepreneur. Choose to commoditize your labor or choose yourself to be a creator, an innovator, an artist, an investor, a marketer, and an entrepreneur. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CO8D3G4&location=311))
- Rejection—and the fear of rejection—is the biggest impediment we face to choosing ourselves. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CO8D3G4&location=327))
- What you need to do is build the house you will live in. You build that house by laying a solid foundation: by building physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CO8D3G4&location=337))
- Success comes from continually expanding your frontiers in every direction—creatively, financially, spiritually, and physically. Always ask yourself, what can I improve? Who else can I talk to? Where else can I look? ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CO8D3G4&location=431))
- Only think about the people you enjoy. Only read the books you enjoy, that make you happy to be human. Only go to the events that actually make you laugh or fall in love. Only deal with the people who love you back, who are winners and want you to win too. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CO8D3G4&location=467))
- Every time you say yes to something you don’t want to do, this will happen: you will resent people, you will do a bad job, you will have less energy for the things you were doing a good job on, you will make less money, and yet another small percentage of your life will be used up, burned up, a smoke signal to the future saying, “I did it again.” The only real fire to cultivate is the fire inside of you. Nothing external will cultivate it. The greater your internal fire is, the more people will want it. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CO8D3G4&location=477))
- Scrub. Clean the toxins off your body. ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CO8D3G4&location=643))
- These are just seeds to be planted. Most people will not follow this particular advice. But I hope everyone follows the advice of the Daily Practice, where you internally get healthy enough to make the decisions about what is right for your life instead of relying on century-old customs and antiquated ideas about “property rights,” “education,” “jobs,” “politics,” and so on that have kept people enslaved with ancient philosophical shackles. The planet is at a tipping point. Spiritually we need to recognize the importance of wanting less in our lives, to the point that we want to disappear. Technologically, we have the tools to make a living anywhere we want. And most of those tools fit inside a device that fits inside our pockets. Being physically, emotionally, and mentally healthy will allow you to combine the spiritual with the technological and sculpt the life that most satisfies you instead of the life that most satisfies society. Don’t think, “I can’t come up with an idea.” You’re getting ahead of yourself. Get all of the bodies aligned first. Later in this book we will learn how to develop the Idea Machine so you can start coming up with these ideas. But trust that when ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CO8D3G4&location=938))
- asks me to go someplace, have a meeting, have a coffee, get on a call, etc., my first instinct is to say no. Much more value is created when I do the things I enjoy, when I work on my own creativity and continue to build the foundation for health. Rushing around the world trying to capture every piece of business will only result in financial and spiritual poverty. It’s much better to work smarter, not harder. ([Location 984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CO8D3G4&location=984))
- every day you wake up and say, “What adventure will happen to me today?” then adventures will happen to you. ([Location 1350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CO8D3G4&location=1350))
