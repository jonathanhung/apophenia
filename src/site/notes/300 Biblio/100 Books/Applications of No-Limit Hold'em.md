- Our concern is that those of you who are not playing against experts may not realize that the calling strategy that Janda assumes may be too loose for your game. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1pqa2q1kdztbd0vk4759yyr))
- Namely games when you are playing against players who are very tight or very timid. So if your opponent bets the pot in a situation where, even before he bet, you thought he was a big favorite to have a monster, bluff catching calls will just lose money. Similarly, if you are against someone who will often be beaten, it makes no difference if you know he almost never bluffs. Hence, if he bets, you should almost always fold. (Well, probably not always since that may “teach” him to change his ways.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1pqapkyc9x4xwn6q7jazg4r))

- In reality, small changes in sizing usually only slightly alter each player’s range. Also, keep in mind that online most players have 100 big blind stacks and a common opening size is a pot-sized open for 3.5 big blinds in most positions other than the button. In addition, good players usually 3-bet a 3.5 big blind open to between 10 and 12 big blinds. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1sb3wxbfr59pr9pk2ckqtxn))
- Observe that even a 20 percent increase in 3-bet sizing only changes how often the original raiser must defend by 4 percent ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1sbhbg11y6a61sfahps69yn))
    - Note: Argument to three bet bluff smaller because it doesn’t change their defense percent much. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Therefore, we can make the following four assumptions about the properties of the worst hand in a game theoretically optimal player’s raise first in range.
  [4](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/58253590#footnote-2057-4-backlink) Of course, in games with certain player types, the expectation for some hands may be highest by calling (often referred to as limping). But that possibility will not be considered here.
  1. The expected value of the hand should be close to if not exactly 0 EV. A hand has an expected value of approximately 0 if it should be opened some but not all of the time. For instance, if an UTG player raises six-five suited only 75 percent of the time then the expected value of the hand should be close to 0. But if he raised with it all the time, he’s seen to be playing too many highly speculative hands early and thus is vulnerable to reraises and other plays. Hence the expectation for the six-five suited would likely now be negative.
  2. The hand should frequently fold when facing a 3-bet. It does not usually make sense to defend against raises with the weakest hands in the opening range.[5](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/58253590#footnote-2057-5) The EV lost will be equal to the size of the preflop open.
  3. The hand will have a total EV of better than -3.5 big blinds when players respond by calling rather than 3-betting. (Even the weakest hand in an opening range can become a strong hand on the flop.)
  4. The hand will not have an EV of greater than +1.5 big blinds when it sees a flop. Poker is a zero sum game, and if the worst hand in a preflop opening range expects to win more than just the blinds, this implies that the cold caller is not playing optimally — his cold call would have to have a negative expected value.

- most people would agree the worst hand in a preflop raising range will on average lose money when called. While it’s true the dead money in the blinds increases the expected value for both the preflop raiser and the cold caller, this is unlikely a strong enough effect to make the weakest hand win money once called.
  Consequently, the worst hand in an opening range will likely lose money once called for several reasons.
  1. It is weaker than the average hand in a preflop cold calling range.
  2. On the flop, the preflop raiser will often be out of position unless he opened on the button or is just called by a blind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1scn1hkyednpb1p54vy973v))
- This showcases the fact that as long as our opponents have any sort of reasonable cold calling ranges, they must be 3-betting significantly less than 30 percent of the time combined. If instead they always reraise with all these hands, we have no incentive to open with the weak hands in our theoretically correct opening range. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1sctpqyfq1xwz7tczr9q9zt))
- When a player responds to a 3-bet by only 4-betting or folding, we have established that they must 4-bet between 25 to 30 percent of their preflop opening range. When facing a 5-bet, they must call between 50 to 60 percent of their 4-betting range. So by multiplying the averages of both, we see that approximately 15.2 percent of the preflop raising range should call a 5-bet.

  Stated again, if the preflop raiser 4-bets 27.5 percent of the time and calls a 5-bet 55 percent of the time, he will end up felting 15.2 percent of his opening range. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1sd27j3918x56a0ttw063cx))
- These defending ranges allow us to get a glimpse of what hands make effective value 3-bets against opponents who defend only by 4-betting or folding. For instance, against a 15 percent raise first in it makes little to no sense to 3-bet and 5-bet a hand like queens or ace-king offsuit since the preflop raiser will never felt worse. A raise first-in of 15 percent is around what many players use for an UTG open, and the inability to 3-bet and 5-bet ace-king offsuit for value against an UTG open in six max is consistent with the theory from “Maximum 3-Betting Ranges” starting on page 41. This does not mean ace-king offsuit will never be a 3-bet against an UTG open, but it’s usually a call. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1sczx00jhz5zjgr6an81hdt))
- how can we know what hands to 3-bet on the button against a cutoff open if we don’t know exactly what range the cutoff is opening and how he responds to a 3-bet? So this requires us to take a much more “trial and error” approach ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1sdsksbqpe91am8m8ge0w47))
- We know the 3-bet percentage from the blinds must be less than 37.5 combined, and at least 43 percent of the 3-bets must be defended against 4-bets. Hence, a good starting point is a 3-betting range from the blinds which consist of 5 percent value hands (TT+, AJs+, AQo+) and 7.5 percent bluffs. This brings the total 3-bet percentage to 12.5 percent in each position.
  This is a pretty standard 3-betting range many good players use. Since 40 percent of the 3-betting range consists of strong hands, it’s not hard to defend at least 43 percent of the range to a 4-bet by mixing in some calls and 5-bet bluffs. If the small blind and big blind each 3-bet 12.5 percent of the time, then the button will be 3-bet 23.4 percent of the time total. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h56qj8gaqj4mcvem3e5bdnn3))
- When we call in the big blind against a button open, we’ll almost always play against a wide range for a small pot. This means our calling range should put more emphasis on flatting with hands which make marginal pairs at a high frequency and can win small and medium sized pots.
  The most obvious hands to call a button open with in the big blind will be suited hands such as king-ten, queen-ten, queen-jack, and king-nine. Of course, other types of hands will be needed in the flatting range, but all of these can make good pairs on the flop which do well against a wide opening range.
  While these hands do well in small raised pots, they will be much trickier to play in 3-bet pots. That’s because 3-betting results in our opponent’s flop range being much stronger, and it’s often difficult, when out of position, to play top pair with a mediocre kicker for a large pot. So calling preflop with hands like the K♣9♣ and Q♣T♠is probably best since this keeps our opponent’s range wide and allows us to frequently have the better kicker when we make a pair.
  Continuing on, hands which work particularly well as 3-bet bluffs are hands which have the potential to make very strong hands by the river and can be bluffed on the flop and turn effectively. For example, hands like the

  and the
  ![](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/reader/parsed_document_assets/58253590/id271-00047.jpeg) 
  make effective bluffs since they have the potential to make nut hands by the river. We almost always know we hold the best hand with suited connectors and rarely have trouble realizing their equity.
  Often times we will 3-bet bluff a hand such as six-five suited, which also could be profitably called preflop. Although calling with a small suited connector likely has a positive expectation, it often makes weak pairs which won’t win at showdown in a raised pot. However, in 3-bet pots, where we will have five outs to two pair and trips and will occasionally win a massive pot, these pairs usually work better.
  Also notice that when our opponent has position, he will usually defend against our 3-bets by flatting since this requires us to play a large pot out of position. Therefore, this allows us to 3-bet with hands that do well in 3-bet pots even if they have to occasionally fold to a 4-bet.
  Unfortunately, not all of our bluffs will be with ideal bluffing hands. It’s often necessary to 3-bet bluff with hands like the K♦7♦ from the small blind despite the fact that they can lead to tougher situations post-flop. We simply aren’t dealt enough suited connectors and suited gapers to balance out our value 3-bets, and as already seen, we should be 3-betting quite aggressively against a button open. While top pair no kicker is usually difficult to play out of position in a large pot, it’s still useful to have some marginal hands in our flop checking range.

- Few concepts in poker are as misunderstood and misapplied as “balancing” a range. If our range is not balanced, our opponent will often be able to take extremely effective lines against that range. A balanced range is the by-product of playing every hand in our range in a way which maximizes, on average, its expected value.
  There will usually be some board textures which favor our opponent’s range more than ours no matter how balanced our preflop range is. For instance, if our range is much weaker than our opponent’s, he will be able to make large bets at a high frequency since he knows we’ll rarely be strong ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1sece2n73ewepav2btj8j53))
- Let’s start by assuming we use a 45 percent button opening range — a reasonable button opening range used by many winning players. When we open to 2.5 big blinds and our opponent 3-bets from the big blind to 9.5 big blinds, he risks 8.5 big blinds to win 4 big blinds. And as we’ve already shown, this means the big blind’s 3-bet cannot be allowed to succeed more than 68 percent of the time. Put another way, it’s important to defend at least 32 percent of our opening range and since our opening range is 45 percent, this means we should defend at least 14.4 percent of all hands ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h56r348b5c43yy7bx3e4cd99))
- In theory, if a player has a perfectly polarized range which includes hands of either 100 percent equity (the pure nuts) or 0 percent equity (pure air), he will choose his bet sizing so that he’s betting an equal fraction of the pot on all three streets and is all in by the river. A formal proof of the mathematics behind this will not be shown here, but it was solved for in The Mathematics of Poker by Bill Chen and Jerrod Ankenman. So it’s important to understand that a player with a completely polarized range will use this bet sizing structure to get all the money in by the river to maximize his earnings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h57svg0xk76fdhb2bcxtm4pg))
- So the conclusion is that defending anywhere between 60 to 70 percent of the time on most boards seems like a reasonable guess ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5afqsaf2wq9hefhb3ckvpxk))
- And throughout this book, the advice given will usually be to defend at least 60 percent of the time on the flop, but players who are more advanced should try to defend a bit more aggressively than this. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5afrvzwhtvrek3gvxwwmtws))
- in a single raised pot, most players bet around 75 percent of the pot which will usually be close to 6 big blinds into an 8 big blind pot. Likewise, players who raise will usually raise this bet to between 16 and 18 big blinds in position — a reasonable sizing which allows the player in position to raise flops aggressively and requires the bettor to defend a large fraction of his flop bets by calling out of position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5afx7df5543kjck06xrhme5))
- So if we raise a 6 big blind bet into an 8 big blind pot to 16 big blinds, our opponent must defend at least 47 percent of the time if he wants to prevent us from making an immediate profit. Moreover, as is usually the case, a small change in raise sizing will not drastically impact this frequency. For instance, a slightly larger raise to 18 big blinds requires our opponent to defend 44 percent of the time to prevent our raise from yielding an immediate profit.
  Our flop raising range will almost always be polarized with strong made hands and bluffs. But on some board textures, draws will be raised as well since they will usually become either very strong or very weak hands by the river, and can be value bet or bluffed accordingly. Also note that by raising, we make our opponent’s range much stronger on the turn, so it makes little sense to raise a hand for value unless it’s stronger than the vast majority of the hands in our opponent’s flop betting range. And since our raising range is polarized, many of the hands in our opponent’s calling range should be bluff catchers which beat our bluff raises but lose to our value raises ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5afyzx4pchv33409k0znmwj))
- When we bet the river, our opponent is getting offered 2-to-1 odds to call our bet, and this requires us to bluff one time for every two value bets, and in this example, since 20 percent of our range on the flop are the nuts (which are the value hands), we’ll be betting (on the river) 30 percent of the total hands we had on the flop. Notice that this keeps our opponent indifferent to calling and folding since both calling and folding have an expected value of zero. In addition, notice our strategy is indifferent to what our opponent does with his bluff catcher — if he calls every time, some of the time, or none of the time, the expected value of our betting range will be the same ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5aga9cb1dgqh6k34fpscgzg))
