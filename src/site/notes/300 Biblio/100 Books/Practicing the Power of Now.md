## Highlights 
---
- As you go more deeply into this realm of no-mind, as it is sometimes called in the East, you realize the state of pure consciousness. In that state, you feel your own presence with such intensity and such joy that all thinking, all emotions, your physical body, as well as the whole external world become relatively insignificant in comparison to it. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002361MNS&location=116))
- IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE, you can practice this by taking any routine activity that normally is only a means to an end and giving it your fullest ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002361MNS&location=125))
- The eternal present is the space within which your whole life unfolds, the one factor that remains constant. Life is now. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002361MNS&location=219))
- If you then become excessively focused on the goal, perhaps because you are seeking happiness, fulfillment, or a more complete sense of self in it, the Now is no longer honored. It becomes reduced to a mere stepping-stone to the future, with no intrinsic value. Clock time then turns into psychological time. Your life's journey is no longer an adventure, just an obsessive need to arrive, to attain, to “make it.” ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002361MNS&location=262))
- old patterns of thought, emotion, behavior, reaction, and desire are acted out in endless repeat performances, a script in your mind that gives you an identity of sorts but distorts or covers up the reality of the Now. The mind then creates an obsession with the future as an escape from the unsatisfactory present. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002361MNS&location=272))
