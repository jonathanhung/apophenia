## Highlights

- The bulk of Nathan's article follows along with analyses of how these issues affect DAOs and governance mechanisms within the crypto space specifically. Nathan focuses on three key problems:
  • **Plutocracy**: "Those with more tokens than others hold more [I would add, *disproportionately* more] decision-making power than others..."
  • **Limited exposure to diverse motivations**: "Cryptoeconomics sees only a certain slice of the people involved. Concepts such as self- sacrifice, duty, and honor are bedrock features of most political and business organizations, but difficult to simulate or approximate with cryptoeconomic incentive design"
  • **Positive and negative externalities**: "Environmental costs are classic externalities—invisible to the feedback loops that the system understands and that communicate to its users as incentives ... the challenge of funding"public goods" is another example of an externality - and one that threatens the sustainability of crypteconomic systems" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6f4yzq20yrbfbxp4cjn4qc4))
