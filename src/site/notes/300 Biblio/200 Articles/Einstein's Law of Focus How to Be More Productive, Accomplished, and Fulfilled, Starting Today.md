- Granted, that's not easy. We all tend to be generalists, even if not by choice. (Starting your own business means wearing many hats.)
  Career, family, friends, personal pursuits -- our buckets are full of disparate tasks. So are our bucket lists.
  As a result, as Newport writes:
  > We can no longer focus on a small number of important project, but find ourselves, instead, rushing between an increasingly overwhelming slate full of a variety of obligations. This time fracture can prevent real accomplishment.

  > Imagine if Einstein maintained a blog, wrote a book, joined a bunch of clubs, and tried to master rowing at the same time he was working on general relativity?

  > We'd still be living in the age of Newton.
  Newport's solution?
  • **Step 1:** Create three columns: professional, personal (family, friends, etc.), and extracurricular (side projects, personal goals, etc.). List everything you're doing in each category.
  • **Step 2:** Choose one or two items from each list that are the most important (and hopefully also provide the greatest return), and put a star beside them.
  • **Step 3:** Identify items that you could stop doing, today, without suffering any real consequences, and cross them out. Think of this step as pruning.
  • **Step 4:** Look at the unmarked items and create a one- to three-week plan to complete them (or escape from them). Maybe that will mean not working on the starred projects for a short period of time, but that's OK. Think of this step as weeding.
  • **Step 5:** Focus on the one or two important things that remain in each category -- and be ruthless about not adding any new items to the list, at least for a while. **Just work the list.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxrp64m30wmpcz4s53sr06k9))
