- The procedure is actually very easy: a starting warm-up followed by a 20-minute best effort, where you have to ride as hard as you can. 
  Finally, you’ll have to multiply the average power registered during these 20 minutes by 0,95: the result is your FTP, Functional Threshold Power. 
  It is **very important that you always do the 5-minute all-out effort in your warm-up**. This is done to reduce your freshness/anaerobic capacity, so that that will not skew your 20-minute wattage numbers higher than what you could truly do for an hour.

- 2. 3 x 1 minute fast-pedaling interval up to max 120rpm, and rest at 80rpm for a minute between intervals 
  3. 5 minutes at a lower pace to recover 
  4. 5 minutes at your maximum pace. You should “explode” at the end of the 5-minute effort. It’s very important you do this before your 20 minute test. 
  5. 5 minutes at a low pace to recover 
  6. **The real FTP: 20 minute at your highest average power. Do not start too hard, but start strong and push yourself!** 
  7. 10-minute recovery at a moderate pace ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8erykyw1qf5f2cwanyarp5x))
