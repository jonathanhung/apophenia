- Indigenous approaches to the world are defined, it is said, by the essential insight as to the creatureliness of the human, its codependency on the life of other species, and their shared finitude (Randazzo & Richter, [2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phil.12343#phil12343-bib-0015)).

- Lear is interested in Plenty Coups in context of his ethical inquiry into how one can live and indeed ought to live when faced with cultural devastation, the loss of one's world, and the death of meaning. The Crow, as Lear tells his readers, “actually did endure a cultural catastrophe” and looking at how their leader, Plenty Coups, faced up to that catastrophe can be instructive for everybody, Lear argues, because we all face such a possibility, now, in this time of “heightened sense” that our own civilization (and by that Lear means that of the west) may be on the brink of collapse (Lear, [2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phil.12343#phil12343-bib-0010), pp. 7–8).

- In 1882, the Crow, with their land having already been reduced from around 33 million acres in the 1850s to just 2 million, were moved to the reservation (Lear, [2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phil.12343#phil12343-bib-0010), p. 27). Forbidden to live the nomadic life that defined their culture, and forbidden to wage war against other tribes, the planting of coup-sticks “ceased to be an intelligible act” (Lear, [2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phil.12343#phil12343-bib-0010), p. 32). Their “paradigm of courage” as Lear put it, collapsed.
  “After this, nothing happened”, said Plenty Coups; a phrase the meaning of which Lear subjects to an extended analysis (Lear, [2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phil.12343#phil12343-bib-0010), p. 37). Planting coup-sticks, counting coups, and performing other rituals no longer happened, the nomadic ways of the past were no longer practiced, and there were no more wars with the Sioux. Plenty Coups, the last great leader of the Crow, one who had lived up to the old ideals definitive of Crow subjectivity, of being a great warrior, hunter and leader, was faced with the seemingly hopeless task of reinventing himself and of finding meaning in new and different ways. For Plenty Coups, life once confined to the reservation was a place where nothing happened. To be a chief he could no longer rely on displaying the hunting or warrior skills in which he had always excelled. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7y5n1pv309sc9m152gqyte2))
- Plenty Coups leads the Crow into a new time, by bearing witness to the collapse of the old world of the Crow. By taking on the responsibility of declaring the ideals that had shaped his life to be dead and gone, Plenty Coups “cleared the ground for the creation of new forms of Crow subjectivity”, in the hope of a future in which things might start to happen for the Crow again (Lear, [2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phil.12343#phil12343-bib-0010), p. 52). This act of clearing, Lear argues, expressed the true courage of Plenty Coups. Not the waging of war, or the taking of life of the enemy, but the courage which it took to say goodbye to what was no longer possible, even if the “what” in question was the very stuff from which his own subjectivity was made, and clear the way for something new; a new time, for his people. The courage, in an obvious sense, to accept defeat, and embrace the end of one's culture, in the hope of a beginning the nature of which it is impossible to know.

- As Donna Haraway puts it pithily, “it is impossible to imagine serious opposition to today's Plantationocene and Capitalocene without aligning with the struggles and reworlding formations led by Indigenous peoples” (Haraway, [2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phil.12343#phil12343-bib-0005), pp. 67–99).

- For when we look at contemporary western discourses on Indigeneity today what we see is a focus on their capacities for survival, for endurance, for perseverance, and what is widely labeled, resilience. For sure, the west is also interested in the imaginations of Indigenous peoples, and that particular form of imagination which Jonathan Lear tells us Plenty Coups possessed in spades, which enabled him to imagine what was otherwise impossible to see or conceive, and to accept the devastation of his entire world. In other words, what attracts the west today to Indigenous peoples are those properties, hidden somewhere in their cultures, which have enabled them to bear the brunt of defeat and destruction, and to have survived in new forms ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7y5x7ft5ac39reh1gb99j5d))
