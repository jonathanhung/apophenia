- the idea that faith is in some sense independent from (and *sometimes* perhaps even opposed to) reason. James argues that we may be justified in adopting a belief even if we don't have enough prior evidence in support of it, and in some cases, 1) we may only have access to supporting evidence only after we have adopted the belief, or 2) our adoption of the belief may make the belief true. For James, religious beliefs are paradigm examples of such beliefs. James also discusses and refers to this idea as 'the duty to believe' and 'the right to believe' in other writings.

- James disagrees with Clifford and defends a **non-evidentialist theory:** which holds that we may be rational in holding a belief even if we don't have sufficient evidence for it. He also maintains that our non-intellectual nature (including our passions and emotions) influence our choices in the face of options, in other words they influence our beliefs and convictions. In doing this, he makes room for (but doesn't commit himself to) **doxastic involuntarism** - that we don't have control over our beliefs, that they are involuntary to a certain extent.

- Our next duty, having recognized this mixed-up state of affairs, is to ask whether it be simply reprehensible and pathological, or whether, on the contrary, we must treat it as a normal element in making up our minds. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcbwgkwk43fr7j16wstcpx0w))
- James thinks religious faith can be deeply valuable not just for the practical benefits it offers your life but because the beliefs that constitute your faith might be deep truths.  He disagrees about the approach of Clifford and the skeptics -- holding back belief until the evidence has come in.  Some kinds of belief -- the kind that are forced, live and momentous -- might require a different sensitivity to evidence.
