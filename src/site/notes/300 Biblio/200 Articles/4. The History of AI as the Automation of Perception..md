- this map is a manifesto — of AI dissidents. Its main purpose is to challenge the mystifications of artificial intelligence. First, as a technical definition of ***intelligence*** and, second, as a political form that would be ***autonomous*** from society and the human. [1](https://kim.hfg-karlsruhe.de/nooscope.ai/#nooscope-ref-01-bottom) In the expression ‘artificial intelligence’ the adjective ‘artificial’ carries the myth of the technology’s autonomy: it hints to caricatural ‘alien minds’ that self-reproduce in silico but, actually, mystifies two processes of proper alienation: the growing geopolitical autonomy of hi-tech companies and the invisibilization of workers’ autonomy worldwide ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc91sk2fhnq814b8mmpzjmmg))
    - Note: AI is not autonomous of human labor, to claim it is making invisible worker struggle [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- knowledge extractivism and epistemic colonialism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc92s30qsyyr3061be8e2fpg))
    - Note: Epistemic colonialism is situate what counts as knowledge within western white orthodoxy. Disembodied, ratioanal, divisible and reductionist [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- secularize AI from the ideological status of ‘intelligent machine’ to one of knowledge instrument ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc92w7n6rra053cv1yrx2fmr))
- more reasonable to consider machine learning as an **instrument of knowledge magnification** that helps to perceive features, patterns, and correlations through vast spaces of data beyond human reach ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc930fhq8eas87ajk7ed7m7y))
- Machine learning is not bringing a new dark age but one of diffracted rationality, in which, as it will be shown, an episteme of causation is replaced by one of automated correlations. More in general, AI is a new regime of truth, scientific proof, social normativity and rationality, which often does take the shape of a *statistical hallucination* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcam3b6s0af7am4qc8996bfk))
- Manuals of machine learning for students, for instance, do not yet share a common terminology. How to sketch, then, a critical grammar of machine learning that may be concise and accessible, without playing into the paranoid game of defining General Intelligence?
