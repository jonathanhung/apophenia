- I have a real issue with the ‘quit the rat race’ narrative.
  It’s been a progressive thing. In truth, three years ago I was taken with the idea. Two years ago I started to see its flaws. A year ago I decided to build a business entirely around opposing the idea. Six months ago I started to get really angry.
  It’s the notion that everything you’ve ever wanted exists beyond the 9–5 grind. That if you can just quit. If you can *just* pluck up the courage to walk into you’re boss’s office and slap that piece of paper on her desk and say ‘cya later’, all your problems will be solved.
  Overnight. The big gaping hole will be filled in an instant. If you can just quit, all your problems, will simply, float away.
  It’s this surface-level thinking that gets people into a pickle. It certainly got me into one. Why is it that people believe they need to quit in order to live a good life?
  Here are some thoughts:
  • Work feels so bad that you feel like you need an equal and opposite force to adjust the balance. Quitting feels big.
  • Quitting is simple and easy to understand. Figure out what else you want to do with your life, is not.
  • It feels like the part in the movie where you get up and start taking ownership of your life. It feels heroic.
  Realistically it’s probably a combination of all of those and not really knowing what entrepreneurship feels like. Entrepreneurship, we can all agree, gets idolised.
  Work for yourself. Make your own rules. Build on your own terms. Take the day off. Do whatever you like. Whenever you like.
  But entrepreneurship is hard. Like really hard. And not only that, if you quit your job, likely your only source of income, you triple the number of problems you have.
  I’ve come to the conclusion that maybe the reason most people want to throw their resignation in their boss’s face is because they approach work as an emotional problem rather than a logical one.
  • Emotional — My job makes me unhappy.
  • Logical — How do I make money doing the things I like to do? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8yprzhpwt8z1znwtbhkg3e2))
