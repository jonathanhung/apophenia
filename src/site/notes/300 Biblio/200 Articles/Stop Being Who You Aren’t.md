- The way out of the trap is to pay attention to your “felt” experience as you move through your life. Learn to notice moments when things feel wrong in some way. You may be fortunate and have a clear sense of “that was inauthentic,” but it may be as simple as “my stomach knotted when I said that.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9epe5kctx2w191cg0jd4d2g))
- While it’s useful, it becomes dangerous the moment you forget that you’re doing it—when the performance becomes your reality. You lose your sense of self.
  To find your way back to it, focus on your inner sensations as you navigate life. Become aware of instances when something feels off. Look kindly and softly at the thing you’re doing that you don’t like and change *nothing* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9epfmvgqsadhxk27w5gkk5z))
- The only task is to notice the dynamics that I’m pointing out nonjudgmentally and trust that change will happen by itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9epkv0mtnqqnb86hekw9z0t))
- I’m not advocating for careless or excessive vulnerability, though. Vulnerability is like fire, which, when handled well, can cook meals, heat homes, and ward off predators.

- Be an archaeologist, not an architect
  My final piece of advice for you: Build your authentic life like an archaeologist, not an architect.
  Consider how these two professionals go about their jobs. An architect plans a building up front before construction can begin, then diligently follows that plan. The plan may be adapted along the way as things come up, but the core approach is that action is led by a clear and detailed plan. An archaeologist works in the opposite way. Something unknown is discovered in the ground, and while there may be ideas of what it could be, the approach is to slowly uncover it. Whenever the truth of what is uncovered differs from the initial ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9eqgaj4zn8t57hqsjvgnhhd))
- Look at all of the multitudes you contain, all your fascinations, your weird hobbies, the people you love, the places you feel drawn to, and ask yourself: Where should the next brushstroke be? What feels resonant? What makes you feel most alive? Go that way and see what shows up. See *who* shows up ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9eqh5zngmtsbmtkppt1j766))
