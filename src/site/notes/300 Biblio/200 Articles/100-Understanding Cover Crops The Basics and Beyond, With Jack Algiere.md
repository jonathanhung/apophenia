- There are three basic families of cover crops, and they each offer specific benefits and challenges:
  • Grains – *like annual grasses, rye, oats, and wheat* These crops build biomass and break up soil compaction with extensive root systems. Their leaves also improve water infiltration by slowing down the movement of water from rain or overhead irrigation.
  • Legumes – *like peas, soybeans, clover, and vetch* These are commonly known as nitrogen-fixers. The varieties within this family each do slightly different things.
  • Broadleaves – *like buckwheat, mustard, and alyssum* These germinate quickly to shade out undesirables, like weeds, and they are easy to turn in for nutrient benefits ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8phwgre6h2eacc67r05vbhh))
- So, when is a cover crop ready to work into the soil? Jack explains that the plant is storing up nutrients right through the point at which it sets flower. Once the crop has set flower, it’s at the apex of benefit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8phyczjwtvak0w86f7eksjw))
- Once you turn the plant materials into the soil, there are certain microorganisms which are triggered to go into digestion mode. They go to work to break down all that fresh organic material. If you sow seeds during this period, the seeds may actually be digested right along with the cover crop ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8phy0sr0tjjm9s38j4txxsx))
- Jack recommends that you allow 2-4 weeks for the cover crop to be broken down by the soil food web before you sow any edible crops ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8phxv89v9vamp9kqwfcyqg6))
- So don’t feel the pressure to cover crop every season – or any season – but never skip the mulch ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8physy6gqf6b6fygsvf25kp))
- There are living mulches too – which might be the perfect compromise between cover crops and mulch in your garden. Alyssum and white clover will protect the soil and feed nutrients back to it. They can be planted around your edibles without out-competing them, **and** they have the added benefit of drawing in pollinators.
  The team at Stone Barns Center often plants alyssum and clover under the tomato crops ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8phz8s6n6m1rxc9mqqm9mk0))
- If you plant late fall season crops, like kale, try adding crimson clover or oats around your kale plants. If you sow the seeds in early fall, the roots of the cover crop won’t be mature enough to compete with your producing kale. Once the kale is done for the year, allow the plants to die in place, the cover crop will grow up around the dead kale plants to protect the soil through the winter and be ready to turn into the soil in spring ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8phzt0c10bkt4jyfvhp23yc))
