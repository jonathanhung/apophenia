## Highlights 
---
- In reality, most of the relevant knowledge needed to coordinate economic activity is distributed throughout the system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h90rbkcn44xj4rjvpevdshwv))
    - Note: this itself is simplification, as decentralization also has poles with their own hierarchies or centers. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- High modernism is a design paradigm characterized by:
  1. Strong belief in scientific and technological progress. High modernists held a utopian faith in experts and intellectuals to use scientific knowledge to master nature and society.
  2. Attempts to control and redesign complex systems. High modernism tried to impose order on organic or historical environments using engineering-inspired methods to rationally plan and optimize systems.
  3. Disregard for context and specificity. A "one-size-fits-all" approach ignored local history, culture, geography, and differences in favor of universal “scientific” principles.
  4. Reliance on legibility and efficiency. The goal was to make systems more transparent and efficient via simplification. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h90re29sqdnvvr29z6xf5hbn))
