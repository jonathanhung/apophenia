## Highlights

- The purpose of the circle is to have everybody in a direct relation to each other, nobody favoured, rather as in a hunter-gatherer society, You’ll find that in order to get the collective behaviour of thought you have to have a certain number of people ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz7yze0293y0jp8wv6q3zp0))
- We meet without a leader, and also without a set purpose or an agenda which is important because if we set a purpose we are going to limit the range of thought to that purpose and there will be some assumptions which cannot be questioned.

- As I said before with anger in individual thought, we are not trying to get rid of anger when we are exploring anger. We actually want to bring it out, though it may be unpleasant, so we can explore its structure and process and go much deeper.

- They say there are really two reasons why people get together: one is to have fun (and they’re not having any fun), and the other is to accomplish a useful purpose (but they’re not doing that either). So they say “why bother?”. It’s neither of those that we’re after - we’re trying to go deeper. There’s a deep malaise in the whole human situation which we’re trying to address.

- The first difficulties which arise are rather elementary in nature - many groups have found this. You find people are playing various roles ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz87bygppwets201fh30rpm))
- Gradually, as the group works together, they’ll get more sensitive. They will give each other space. This is not something that satisfies any formula. People just learn to be sensitive in this way. They give space so that people are not rushed. They also have to learn that they cannot engage in long trains of thought in a Dialogue, because meanwhile the whole conversation moves on and your thought is irrelevant. All sorts of little skills are learned like that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz8aj4w01wc97gn1exb9dzj))
- Then we come to the crucial field of Dialogue, which is when we get to fundamental assumptions. People may very often avoid fundamental assumptions, remaining very polite with each other and avoiding difficult issues. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grz8bmr7j1y4n40z84p93d9a))
