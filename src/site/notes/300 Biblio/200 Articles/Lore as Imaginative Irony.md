- often the transparently false and cringe theaters of absurdity that effective lore penetrates are neither accidental, nor the result of cluelessness. They are deliberately crafted as a test of power. A dictator, or authoritarian head of HR pursuing a political agenda, who can force you to pretend that lies are truths, and behave accordingly (all the way to repeating those lies without smirking), has proof of their real power over you. Trump for example, routinely made people lie for him, as a test of loyalty. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1503426514/19454961))

- the People of Web3 seem to instinctively grok everything I’ve just laid out, and don’t appear to be defeatist about the challenges involved in lorecrafting.
  The bad news is: it is not clear whether this is because they have a sophisticated feel for the challenges of lorecraft, or whether it is just a youthful lulz-seeking that has yet to encounter serious tests of its organizational capabilities.

- baroque as that style which deliberately exhausts (or tries to exhaust) all its own possibilities and which borders on its own parody…I would say that the final stage of all styles is baroque when that style only too obviously exhibits or overdoes its own tricks.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1503426514/19455091))
