- **Chapter 3: Critiques of growth** 
  After reading so much degrowth stuff, I’m used to skim the critique section because it’s usually always the same. Except here it isn’t. The authors have conducted a remarkable synthesis (the chapter is 100-page long) and summarised it into seven critical strands (*ecological*, *socio-economic*, *cultural*, *anticapitalist*, *feminist*, *anti-industrialist*, *anti-development*), each opening towards a different curative concept (*sufficiency*, *alternative hedonism*, *conviviality*, *dépense*, *care*, *convivial technologies*, *pluriverse*). Each of these strands exist on their own, but what makes degrowth special is that it hosts the seven of them in a kind of ultimate, growth-bashing Megazord. “Degrowth’s strength is its holistic view. [It] relies not on a single strand of growth critique but has, from its very inception, braided the seven emancipatory strands discussed in this chapter together into a cohesive, well-developed, and broad critique of growth” (p.177).
  **Critique n°1**
  According to the **ECOLOGICAL CRITIQUE**, economic growth “destroys the ecological foundations of human life and cannot be transformed to become sustainable” (p.78). The economy, like any physical system, is subject to the natural laws of physics. And so, the bigger an economy, the more difficult it becomes to reduce its biophysical throughput. “Any society that relies on compound rate of economic growth will eventually face ultimate limits, which manifest themselves in the breakdown of the complex ecosystems upon which growth relies” (p. 83). This ecological critique leads to a defence of ***sufficiency*** (the nemesis of ecologically destructive growth), “a reduction in the consumption of raw materials, energy, and land which nevertheless offers a basis for well-being” (p.93).    
  **Critique n°2**
  According to the **SOCIO-ECONOMIC CRITIQUE**, economic growth “mismeasures our lives and thus stands in the way of well-being and equality of all” (p.78). Essentially, GDP growth is not necessary (and sometime even counterproductive) for the betterment of quality of life. This is a return to [Herman Daly](https://www.routledge.com/Herman-Dalys-Economics-for-a-Full-World-His-Life-and-Ideas/Victor/p/book/9780367556952)’s concept of “[uneconomic growth](https://books.google.se/books/about/Beyond_Growth.html?id=JGuw2vinPmYC&redir_esc=y)”: above a certain income level, further growth bears more costs than benefits. They explain this “[Easterlin paradox](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780122050503500087)” in five steps: (1) more is not always better, (2) especially since happiness is determined by relative income levels (moving everyone up is not changing relative position), (3) GDP is a poor measure of well-being, (4) the neoliberal turn of the 1980s has undercuts the foundation of welfare, and (5) secular stagnation and the rise inequality smothers the collective benefits of growth. This critique “sees the end of economic growth not as a threat, but as an opportunity for new forms of well-being and a good life for all” (p.94), for an [***alternative hedonism***](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3693-post-growth-living).
  **Critique n°3**
  According to the **CULTURAL CRITIQUE**, economic growth “produces alienating ways of working, living, and relating to each other and nature” (p.78). Modern, industrial life simply sucks. The workplace has turned into a domain of alienation (especially for those having “[bullshit jobs](https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/)” [David Graeber]), consumers drown under a stressful avalanche of options, stripped of their autonomy by pervasive advertisement, and culture as a whole is slowly turning into an [accelerating](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/social-acceleration/9780231148344) competition for who owns the most stuff (which again, doesn’t make us happy). This line of critique denounces the reductive definition of humans as *Homo economicus* and warns against emergence of modern [growth subjects](https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/endf_mental_infrastructures.pdf). This critique leads to a call for ***conviviality***: “forms of social organization that enable mutual dependencies, the negotiation of interpersonal relationships, and good coexistence” (p.116). 
  **Critique n°4**
  According to the **CRITIQUE OF CAPITALISM**, economic growth “depends on and is driven by capitalist exploitation and accumulation” (p.78). Owners of capital constantly reinvest surpluses in order to maximise profits, which accelerates the wheel of capital accumulation resulting in more environmental degradation and wider inequality. The so-called ‘growth’ is based on an appropriation of unpaid labour and energy from humans and non-human nature – an “[accumulation by dispossession](https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_AMX_035_0071--the-new-imperialism-accumulation-by-disp.htm)” [David Harvey]. “[W]ithout unpaid inputs – both from people (unpaid domestic work or neo-colonial exploitation, but also public bailouts) and the raw materials and energy of nature – production costs would rise so far that profits would fall and accumulation would come to a standstill” (p.124). This critique leads to the concept of [***dépense***](https://www.routledge.com/Towards-a-Society-of-Degrowth/Romano/p/book/9781032176734) which “offers a way to go beyond a purely productivist conception of the economy” (p.128), and to the idea of “self-determined post-scarcity society” (p.128) where one would regain the “autonomy to collectively create public abundance” (p.129) while [collectively deliberating and setting limits](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=29999).
  **Critique n°5**
  According to the **FEMINIST CRITIQUE**, economic growth “is based on gendered over-exploitation and devalues reproduction” (p.78). In a “[capitalocentric](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-end-of-capitalism-as-we-knew-it)” society [J.K. Gibson-Graham], “the vital reproductive work of society – which is largely carried out by women, in particular Indigenous and Black women, and women of colour – remains fundamentally unacknowledged, invisible, devalued, and precarious” (p.133). They use the [iceberg analogy](http://avery.wellesley.edu/Economics/jmatthaei/transformationcentral/solidarity/solidaritydocuments/diverseeconomies.pdf) to argue that “what is usually identified as ‘the economy’ – commodities, labour, and investment – is in fact only the tip of the iceberg, beneath which lies an economy that is invisible, reproducing and sustaining life, and which makes the market economy possible in the first place” (p.135). “‘[R]eproductive’ activities (subsistence labour, the ‘under-developed’ world, the home, nature, and femininity) are subordinated to ‘productive’ activities (wage labour, Western civilization, the public sphere, and masculinity)” (p.138). This critique opens up to the corrective concept of ***care*** and of a ***caring economy*** geared towards supporting life.
  **Critique n°6**
  According to the **CRITIQUE OF INDUSTRIALISM**, economic growth “gives rise to undemocratic productive forces and techniques” (p.78). “The development of productive forces and technology in modern societies have become authoritarian, alienating, and restrictive of self-determination” (p.143). Technological ‘progress’ is not a neutral process and the kind of innovations incentivised under a growth-based, capitalist economy is not necessarily beneficial to all. The car, for example, holds a “[radical monopoly](https://debate.uvm.edu/asnider/Ivan_Illich/Ivan%20Illich_Energy%20and%20Equity.pdf)” [Ivan Illich] over choices of mobility, smothering alternative modes of transport, and centralised sources of energy like nuclear electricity can indirectly restructure society towards “more alienated, authoritarian, militarized, and highly centralized social systems” (p.149). This leads to a call for a ***post-industrial*** society, made of non-authoritarian, non-alienating, and non-exploitative technologies, often referred to as “[convivial tools](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652617304213?casa_token=e_0CuBc7OMUAAAAA:Mu2EYYQt ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h73tc5z5r6vfethjntkn07ns))
