- The case for body doubling
  In his book [*The Now Habit*](https://www.amazon.com/Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination-Guilt-Free/dp/1585425524), psychologist Neil Fiore writes that a primary reason we procrastinate is because as humans, we are social beings, but focused work requires quiet time alone. If our social and play needs aren’t being met, sitting down to work on a task by oneself can be highly aversive.
  Moreover, as mentioned above, we tend to procrastinate on tasks that bring up difficult emotions, like fear, pressure, or self-doubt. When a task is aversive and being alone is *also* aversive, it’s no wonder we end up seeking relief by switching over to email, Twitter/X, or Slack.

- when we are in the presence of another person, we actually respond differently to perceived threats—a phenomenon known as [social buffering](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8697704/#:~:text=In%20what%20is%20termed%20social,%2C%202006%3B%20Kiyokawa%20%26%20Hennessy%2C). In this way, body doubling reduces the aversiveness of solitude *and* mitigates the unpleasantness of the task itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9631qbv3k0fyj6kbq7atzzm))
- Work with a friend or colleague
  Inviting a friend or colleague to body double with you is the simplest, cheapest, and least structured approach. All you need to do is find someone who is also interested in your target activity, be it writing, coding, or admin, and then pick a time to work on it together.

- Hire someone part-time
  Another great option for body doubling can be to hire someone to support you on specific tasks. 
  One reason to try this is when you want more consistent accountability than might be available from your friends or colleagues. For example, [Dan has written](https://every.to/superorganizers/pile-avoidance?sid=23827) about how he hired an “email babysitter” to hop on calls with him several days a week and process his inbox. It would have been hard to find a friend who had the desire and ability to meet that often, so hiring someone made the most sense.
  Another reason to bring on paid support is when you can benefit from outside expertise in the area you’re focused on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h96341v190gcfbprvhkqpj2h))
