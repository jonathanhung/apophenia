- In [*Socialism: Utopian and Scientific*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/Engels_Socialism_Utopian_and_Scientific.pdf), Engels saw the emergence of 19th-century utopian socialism, signalled by the work of Saint-Simon, Fourier and Owen, as a reaction to the defeated aspirations of the French Revolution. By the early 1800s it was already clear that it had failed to deliver the kingdom of reason and justice promised by the Enlightenment; instead, the triumph of the big bourgeoisie had brought corruption, war and the poverty produced by super-abundance. Industrial production was barely developed, and the proletariat, wrote Engels, appeared to these radicals as ‘incapable of independent political action’ – ‘an oppressed, suffering order’ which required help from outside. In these conditions, the utopian socialists attempted in idealist fashion to evolve the solution to social problems ‘out of the human brain’:
  > Society presented nothing but wrongs; to remove these was the task of reason. It was necessary, then, to discover a new and more perfect system of social order and to impose this upon society from without by propaganda, and, wherever it was possible, by the example of model experiments. These new social systems were foredoomed as utopian; the more completely they were worked out in detail, the more they could not avoid drifting off into pure phantasies.
  Two hundred years on – and in the wake of the defeated aspirations of the 20th-century revolutions – utopian eco-socialists appear to be repeating the same pattern. A new ecological order will be conjured up out of their brains, trialed in micro-experiments – as in *The Future of Degrowth* – or, as in *Half Earth Socialism*, ‘imposed from without by propaganda’. What is missing here is any analysis of the concrete class relationships that both inhibit such transformations or might bring them about. For Engels, winning real socialism hinges on class struggle: ‘Socialism was no longer an accidental discovery of this or that ingenious brain, but the necessary outcome of the struggle between two historically developed classes – the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h73aty8tn5ff1dd5v0mww5he))

- Engels argued that ‘scientific’ – that is, self-critical, rigorously conceptualized and empirically tested – socialism must be rooted in an investigation of historical development: ‘the process of evolution of humanity.’ He himself lived through the epochal ruptures of mass proletarianization and the industrial revolution. The 20th century saw those processes accelerate, in what [Farshad Araghi calls](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4120791) ‘global depeasantization’ – a process continuing in China today, in what is probably the [largest rural-urban migration in human history](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-greatest-migration-china_b_2782076). According to [David Harvey](https://www.redpepper.org.uk/Their-crisis-our-challenge/), global capitalism has added something like two billion people to the global proletariat over the past twenty years. While Marx and Engels thought this mass proletarianization would swell industrial factories, the result has more been the rise of a vast ‘informal proletariat’ deemed superfluous to the needs of capital; a surplus humanity, housed in a [Planet of Slums](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii26/articles/mike-davis-planet-of-slums).

- Clearly, the productive forces must develop beyond their historically entrenched reliance upon fossil fuel. Yet, the private ownership of energy prevents this from taking place – a contradiction realized through the wider crisis of planetary climate change, from [rising seas](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190829-bangladesh-the-country-disappearing-under-rising-tides) in Bangladesh to [drought](https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/horn-africa-drought-humanitarian-update-10-june-2022) in the horn of Africa. All known technological pathways to halting environmental breakdown are ‘fettered’ by the social relations of production: renewable energy might be getting cheaper, but that does not necessarily [translate to profits](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563467.2021.1926957). Other solutions like nuclear fission, green hydrogen, scaled geothermal and carbon removal all present the same key obstacle: they cost too much, and fossil fuels are more profitable. In sum, solving climate change requires *new* social relations of production that would *develop the productive forces* toward clean production.
