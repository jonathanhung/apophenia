- Here’s the second, “fidelity to daily tasks,” from Albert Borgmann discussing the social dimensions of tending a hearth:
  > “It was a focus, a hearth, a place that gathered the work and leisure of a family and gave the house its center. Its coldness marked the morning, and the spreading of its warmth the beginning of the day. It assigned to the different family members tasks that defined their place in the household. The mother built the fire, the children kept the firebox filled, and the father cut the firewood. It provided for the entire family a regular and bodily engagement with the rhythm of the seasons that was woven together of the threat of cold and the solace of warmth, the smell of wood smoke, the exertion of sawing and of carrying, the teaching of skills, and **the fidelity to daily tasks**.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hd21fwc05js2e38v8wp76z74))

- Suddenly, previously dignified work becomes “drudgery,” labor that some might have found satisfying becomes insufficiently “creative.” The sense is that we might unlock some higher plane of existence if only we adopt a more efficient technique or outsource our involvement in a task to a new technology. Then and only then will we be able to do “what really matters,” and “what really matters” is always sufficiently vague to allow us to imagine that we are choosing these ends for ourselves and simply being empowered by new tools to achieve it.

- I imagine that in some cases the very same task could be experienced and described either as Wu’s tyranny or Borgmann’s fidelity. I do not want to succumb to the tyranny of tiny tasks. I do want to live so that I might speak of my fidelity to daily tasks, inasmuch as this implies the performance of tasks that legitimately elicit such fidelity. But what makes the difference?
