- Techniques for [tactical mindfulness](https://every.to/no-small-plans/tactical-mindfulness)—using mind-based or “top-down” tools to influence our thoughts and feelings—have exploded in popularity.
  But when our nervous systems are hijacked and adrenaline is coursing through our veins, unless we have thousands of hours of mindfulness training, it can be hard to avoid panic mode, let alone drop into meditation.
  Fortunately, it is possible (and, as I will argue, far more efficient) to leverage your physiology—known as “bottom-up” practices—by using breathwork to self-regulate and positively impact your internal state in real-time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9638zfgycr67fj8m16ybtnh))
    - Note: topdown (meditation) is contrasted to bottoms-up (breathwork) means towards self-regulation [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- unproductive thought loops and feelings exacerbate the issue. These reactive states are the underlying cause of ineffectiveness, reactivity, conflict, and regrettable decision-making. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h963b43yrq8s75q77e2yt42m))
- When you breathe through the mouth and into the upper lungs, signals are relayed to activate the *sympathetic* or activating part of your nervous system, creating a cascade effect that communicates to your endocrine system to secrete adrenaline and cortisol—which, in turn, generate measurable [shifts in your blood chemistry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5368202/).
  These shifts in blood chemistry impact the emotions you feel and even the tone of thoughts that will arise—like impulsive actions, anxious thoughts, and feelings of frustration. We can fall into a trap as these unproductive thoughts and feelings reinforce or even exacerbate the breath pattern that activates the sympathetic response in the nervous system.

    - Note: breath is connecting to anxiety, impulsive actions and frustrated feelings. unproductive thoughts and feelings exacerbate the problem in a feedback cycle. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Here, the common strategy is to attempt to *think* our way out of the stress. You may be familiar with [tactical mindfulness,](https://every.to/superorganizers/tactical-mindfulness) cognitive reframes, or thoughts of loving-kindness to change your state of mind. These act as [top-down interventions](https://www.llnl.gov/news/national-ignition-facility-achieves-fusion-ignition) for throwing a wrench into the negative thought spiral. However, it’s possible—and more effective—to shift your breathing pattern to generate calmer thoughts and feelings.
  There are important [neurological reasons why](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4017164/). Our nervous system consists of 80% of *afferent* neurons, which move from the body to the brain—in contrast to roughly 20% of *efferent* neurons, which run in the opposite direction, from the brain to the body.
  As a result, so-called*bottom-up* interventions—or practices that leverage our physiology by consciously shifting our respiratory or visual systems—are 4x more effective at altering our blood chemistry and, therefore, shifting our state.

    - Note: rather than mind over matter, use matter to affect the mind. discusses the fact that there are more body -> brain neurons than the other direction. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Working with clients, I will often talk about “state before story”—the idea that the stories we tell ourselves and the perspectives we inhabit are a function of our nervous system state.
  If our system is overwhelmed or dysregulated, the mind will find reasons to explain why. At times, we might even invent false reasons to justify the internal anxious state. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h963p1sd6jqpt2p9fh5qn5th))
