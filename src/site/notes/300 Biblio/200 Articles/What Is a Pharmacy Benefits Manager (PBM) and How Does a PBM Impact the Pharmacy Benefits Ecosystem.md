## Highlights

- A pharmacy benefits manager, also referred to as a PBM, is, in essence, the intermediary in between each stakeholder in of the [pharmacy benefits marketplace](https://truveris.com/pharmacy-benefits-solutions/?utm_source=truveris&utm_medium=blog-pbm-hl). Many people assume that pharmacy benefits come directly from health insurance providers, but in reality, PBMs are doing the bulk of the work in connecting people to prescriptions for over 80% of employers in the U.S. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haz0rsjchpkd13dhxgsvw4jm))
- PBMs are hired by corporate employers, health plans, labor unions, and other organizations to interface with drug manufacturers and to process prescription-related claims. I ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haz0r15a1nwneyadn35m8pk7))
- PBMs negotiate pricing with a large network of retail or mail pharmacies. Due to their size and thus leverage, PBMs can also buy drugs from manufacturers at a discount. This enables them to offer patients and employers greater access to medications across multiple retail chains – at competitive pricing.

- PBMs are responsible for determining the affordability of a drug and putting [programs in place to help patients access medications](https://truveris.com/build-better-copay-assistance-programs/?utm_source=truveris&utm_medium=blog-pbm-hl) and use the most effective treatments. These programs include:
  1. Rebate programs
  PBMs negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to determine the level of rebates the manufacturer will pay the PBM for certain drugs. Depending on the [PBM contract](https://truveris.com/four-dynamic-areas-pharmacy-benefits-contract-you-should-know/?utm_source=truveris&utm_medium=blog-pbm-hl) between the PBM and the employer, the PBM will pass all, some, or none of the manufacturer’s rebate to the employer.
  2. Formulary coverage
  A [drug formulary](https://truveris.com/drug-formulary/?utm_source=truveris&utm_medium=blog-pbm-hl) is a list of drugs, both branded and [generic](https://truveris.com/mac-pricing/?utm_source=truveris&utm_medium=blog-pbm-hl), that are covered within a certain plan. The list is determined by PBMs (with the assistance of physicians and other clinical experts) to include the drugs that will be most effective and affordable. Given the volume of medications that go through a PBM, when a drug is covered on the formulary, it’s much more likely to be prescribed by a physician. Ideally, a pharmaceutical manufacturer wants to make sure their drugs are covered in the formulary in order to reach the patients that need them.
  3. Prior authorization programs
  Prior authorization is a cost-savings feature of pharmacy benefits plans that helps ensure the appropriate use of prescription drugs. Prior authorizations are designed to prevent improper prescribing or the improper use of certain drugs. PBMs identify specific types of drugs that require a prior authorization. When a prior authorization occurs, the patient must then get approval from their carrier before the insurer agrees to cover the drug and allow the patient to begin treatment.
  4. Step therapy programs
  Step therapy programs are a type of prior authorization program that applies to both traditional and [specialty drugs](https://truveris.com/difference-between-specialty-drug?utm_source=truveris&utm_medium=blog-pbm-hl). Step therapy programs are designed to make sure that patients have at least tried a less expensive drug that’s proven effective for a specific condition, before moving on to a more expensive drug. Therefore, PBMs often create step therapy programs for the patients on their plans to adhere to – with the goal of saving the employer money.
