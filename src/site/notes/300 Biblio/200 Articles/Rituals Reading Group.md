- Within the enormous project of shifting away from the ingrained norms of capitalist individualism and towards interdependence, a prevalent pathway is that of worldbuilding: reimagining new narratives and poetics for engineering new realities. This has been taking place in areas like theory, science fiction, poetry, video games, speculative architecture, and while the implementation of new worlds into lived realities happens over vast time and space, where can working towards this be materialized in the day-to-day? A guiding praxis for this might be the ancient technology of ritual; a demystification and re-enchantment of ritual can elucidate how it can alter the atmosphere to renew relations. “Rituals are symbolic acts. They represent, and pass on, the values and orders on which a community is based”(Byung-Chul Han). Existing in a designated realm of enchantment, ritual allows for imagining avenues outside of the limited arenas of knowledge and possibility constructed within western capitalist society. Enchantment itself has underlying connotations of magic, a space intrinsically dedicated to a reimagining outside of a conventional “reality.” If we need ways to reimagine and renew our current epistemes, this is the type of realm we need to play with in order to transcend our preconditioned form of knowing and creating. Ritual can imagine alternative realities due to its affinity towards an enchanted realm of transformation and what sets this fantastical reworlding apart is that it is sutured with day-to-day object-beings, making it simultaneously grounded in the material world.
