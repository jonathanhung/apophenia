- It is also the case that the material prosperity so many of us enjoy comes at a cost to our well-being such that many are beginning to question whether we’ve not unwittingly assented to a devil’s bargain. Here I am thinking, for example, of the equally well-documented rise in rates of burnout, mental health disorder, and loneliness. More speculatively, I’d even suggest that we’ve somehow stumbled into a crisis of desire. Our techno-economic order takes the shape of a great engine of desire, training us to want what it offers and encouraging us to forget our deep desire for that which cannot be bought.

- What practices can thrive outside of the bounds of economic rationality, optimization, and consumption? Is there a way to recalibrate the rhythms of our days and weeks and months and years so that they generate meaning and a measure of internal and communal harmony?

- Humility is not a peculiar habit of self-effacement,” as Murdoch observed, “it is selfless respect for reality and one of the most difficult and central of all virtues.”
  Humility and a refusal of the myth of limitlessness. Because if there is anything that makes us complicit in propagating the exhausting, depleting, surface skimming way of life, it is the refusal to acknowledge our good and proper limits as mortal, embodied creatures.

- My impulse is that our rest and relaxation ought be in service of some viable, shared alternatives to Modernity, yet such a perspective risks turning rest and renewal into a project (which would be very Modernist of us). We also risk a kind of hydraulic experience of life, in which we are constantly oscillating between the enervating nature of modernity and the innervating practices we develop (or rediscover) to sustain ourselves through modernity. Again, this is Ellul's observation of "human techniques." Plenty of rest and renewal practices have been developed as alternatives to Modernity, only to ultimately become incorporated within it. Buddhist Meditation might be the exemplar here, but there are many others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcv9j21n2yjp4efzeb2y97gd))
