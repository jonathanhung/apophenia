- The proposal interface adds another layer of structure. It guides the kinds of proposals that can be made by presenting the actions one can take in the ABI (Application Binary Interface) in a user-friendly way.
  All decisions and conversations are well-documented in the Discord. The information is easily accessible, which helps new members of the community familiarize themselves with the improvement process. To further increase transparency, the community also started a public Trello board that contains the social profiles of all the delegates.
