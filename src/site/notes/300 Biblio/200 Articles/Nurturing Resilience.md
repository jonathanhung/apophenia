- Bowlby’s early insights led to the
  development of modern-day attachment theory; and he is now considered, along with Mary
  Ainsworth, to be the founder of this psychological framework for understanding relationships and
  human development. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp6b861twpz40p61hc9m2h2))
- Because of the mother’s biological role in child-rearing—including carrying the child, giving birth
  to the child, and often breastfeeding the child—Bowlby identified the mother, or the caregiver, as the
  one responsible for meeting the infant’s emotional need for survival, not just the infant’s physical
  needs. The mother’s proximity to the child became increasingly more relevant to Bowlby’s research,
  in terms of not only her physical presence, but her ability to meet the child’s emotional and spiritual
  needs as well. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp6cqpe9bhajqje18dxh8mq))
- Bowlby noticed that the boys in the study showed little to no empathy toward others.
  They seemed noticeably disconnected from the world and people around them, and operated with
  little to no respect toward life or property. His results indicated a direct correlation between the boys
  who committed theft and a separation event from their mothers or primary caregivers. Bowlby
  viewed maternal separation and deprivation as a direct cause of the boys’ altered view of their
  environment (Bowlby 1944), which more than likely gave Bowlby insight into his feelings about his
  childhood and separation from his mother. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp6dytadweqks8mtgfgph03))

- By 1965, Ainsworth and her assistant Barbara Wittig had designed the Strange Situation procedure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp6n4je3aq87yergzajdnvb))
- Anxious-avoidant insecure attachment: Children in this category seemed to avoid the mother or
  ignore her departure from and return to the lab. The children seemed uninterested in the room
  itself and typically chose not to explore the space ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp6vy1z5nf2zg4hdrdw3324))
- Anxious-resistant insecure attachment: These children showed distress even before the mother
  left the room. They became clingy and difficult to comfort upon the mother’s return. This group
  was later divided into two subsets: one showed signs of resentment toward the mother for
  leaving, and the second showed signs of helpless passivity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp6w4rea22dh9vp1j34b4z4))
- Disorganized/disoriented attachment: This fourth category was noted by Mary Main and Judith
  Solomon (Main and Solomon 1986), who developed the Adult Attachment Interview. They
  noticed a group of children who didn’t meet the criteria of the original three categories of
  attachment behavior. The children in this group appeared not to possess coping skills. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp6wjfr5cvn021bnqbh8t5y))
- One of the criticisms of this early research is that it
  places too much emphasis on the mother and her sensitivity to her child, and that there are other
  factors influencing the child’s attachment behaviors (such as the child’s own temperament). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp6xhsxx36a2pkrgs5e5fgb))
- In this way, parents and caregivers play a crucial role in helping young children soothe their
  intense emotions, and these interactions between parent and child will shape the child’s ability—or
  inability—to regulate his own emotions later in life. This process is called co-regulation because the
  parent steps in as a mentor and external source of soothing when the child feels distressed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp75pqxx2g6jhg8kgbj09tp))
- This process of co-regulation creates a foundation for neurosequential development for the child
  (Schore 1994). In other words, once this co-regulation pattern is formed, the child can grow in
  productive, healthy, and predictable ways toward emotional maturity. This isn’t purely about feeling
  a “better” emotion, but about regulating our level of arousal when the autonomic nervous system is
  activated, and about regulating our affect in the company of others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp75yf34aa4k2wbhm2500xb))

- Dr. Allan Schore (2001) sees the transfer of regulation from external (relying on others) to internal
  (developing the capacity to self-regulate) as the primary task of early development. T ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp771bc171m32emye1971ja))
    - Note: Do I have sufficient capability for self-regulation: impulse control and self-control in order to form relationships aligned with social norms of our groups [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- In relationships, co-regulation helps us maintain more effective self-regulation. David
  Sbarra and Cindy Hazan note that “The ability to quickly use the resources of a close other may
  represent a so-called fast route to emotional regulation” (Sbarra and Hazan 2008, 157). Because
  there is little to no thinking involved, co-regulation can more quickly bring down arousal because we
  don’t have to think it through on our own. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp7dpesrqbccdskd4xgewg7))
- The loss of regulatory capacity is one of the consequences of traumatic stress. With the loss of
  regulation comes loss of healthy functioning in many physiological, behavioral, and social processes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp7bjv7785qxqnbkf7kzff4))
- under threat, we will try to mediate the threat using a reverse phylogenetic
  journey through our evolutionary development, beginning with the most socially and physiologically
  complex responses and descending to the most ancient and primitive responses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp7w76971nhxvrq7nc5t62x))
- We will first try to mediate the threat via social engagement or social behaviors, such as friendly
  connection, appeasement behaviors, submission, or negotiation. This utilizes the ventral vagus
  system. If that doesn’t work, or if social engagement isn’t appropriate because the threat is purely
  physical, we will then mobilize our active threat response, such as fight-or-flight behaviors like
  kicking, screaming, or running. This utilizes the sympathetic system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp92aex3zttdbk26j9thpez))
- The ventral vagus provides nerve supply for structures and organs above the diaphragm, such as
  the esophagus and bronchi of the lungs, as well as the structures of speech—the larynx and pharynx. It
  also communicates with the nerve that supplies the muscles of the face. This supports what we call
  “vocal prosody,” or the ability to vary our vocal intonation and rhythm according to our situation and
  audience.
  The ventral vagus also partly governs and influences regulation of the heart. It acts as a brake on
  the sympathetic system, slowing the heartbeat and lowering blood pressure. Because this portion of
  the vagus is myelinated, it can perform that function with accuracy and nuance. Porges refers to this
  process as the “vagal brake.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp9fjwm812fpxw90s6w9cne))
- When the vagal brake is
  lifted within a gentle enough range, the heart’s pacemaker increases our heart rate, without our having
  to secrete stress chemicals that would signal the sympathetic system to activate more fully. In other
  words, the vagal brake allows us to react with greater discernment and less overall physical
  disruption. Although we might feel our heart rate increase, we would not feel the rush of adrenaline
  that would accompany a sympathetically induced activation response. This finely tuned interplay
  between the vagal brake and the heart creates a nuanced dance in our physiology that supports our
  ability to engage with others (Porges 2009).
  When we are able to access this part of our physiological “platform,” we have the physiological
  support for productive and helpful social behaviors—the ability to interact with others in ways that
  preserve our relationships and connections. Additionally, as will be discussed later in this chapter,
  lifting the vagal brake in this way conserves body resources that would otherwise be “spent” on the
  activation process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp9n4dkwy9pfhadvxy5y8eg))
- The Dorsal Vagus
  The dorsal vagus is the second sub-branch of the parasympathetic system, also slowing our
  physiology, but in a less nuanced way than the ventral vagus. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp9qet0n8nbxbtmsgc6mq5j))
- Porges refers to the dorsal vagus as the “sloppy” branch of the pair.
  The dorsal system is considered a holdover from a phylogenetically more primitive system that
  was later adapted for other purposes in the human physiology. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp9qq9am6bvtfbsw68qsq0r))
- When an infant is distressed and has moved into sympathetic dominance, she needs her caregiver to
  provide soothing via feeding, touching, making reassuring sounds, and responding to the specific
  source of distress by changing a wet diaper, or applying lotion to irritated skin, for example. If a
  caregiver becomes unavailable for extended periods of time, the infant faces increasingly limited
  options physiologically, in which case:
  1. The child will continue to fuss and cry indefinitely, becoming inconsolable even when someone
  does eventually arrive, or until she is exhausted and falls asleep. This is based on sympathetic
  arousal.
  2. Or the infant will cascade into the survival response of the dorsal system, moving into
  conservation physiology and becoming quiet and still. This is not immobility without fear, but the
  freeze physiology activating to conserve resources and preserve life—the tonic immobility that
  follows unresolved fear. This reaction originates in the dorsal vagus system, producing freeze or
  shutdown.
  In either instance, the infant remains in a physiological state that is affiliated with survival effort.
  Survival physiology—either extreme sympathetic arousal or dorsal freeze—is meant to be a
  temporary state that serves the specific survival purpose of preserving life at all costs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfp9y875nsejsfy6dtq50pxy))
- For our purposes in this chapter, it’s
  important to understand that a lack of regulation is likely to affect all layers of the self: physiological,
  behavioral, emotional, and social. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk3ft0r1ejxd22mq4ms41g1x))
- We may see this not only in physiological responses, but behaviorally as well. It’s not uncommon
  to see a child simultaneously clinging to a parent, while also hitting that parent. The child is being
  angry and aggressive, but also needs connection with and reassurance from the parent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk3fxx1rb4fyvt06a9ayy33q))
- We focus here on a specific
  aspect of ANS function, one that’s particularly relevant when working with clients who experience
  more severe dysregulation, the type that arises when the ANS no longer works within the reciprocal
  range of response. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk3fy804y6f5mw98r07yqgpr))
- Foundational Dysregulation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk3fye6atdfmctcn35w87pdt))
- Even within this reciprocal range, there is still room for the stress response, or ANS responses that
  eventually become maladaptive. For example, harsh parenting, marital conflict, or controlling
  parental behaviors are linked to children who exhibit chronic low vagal tone, meaning their
  sympathetic systems remain in a higher activation state on a more ongoing basis, with chronically
  inadequate braking from the parasympathetic system. This ANS response is in turn associated with
  anxiety, behavioral issues, and other mental health problems. In the face of chronic stressors within
  the family environment, the child’s sympathetic system may continually activate as part of his threat
  response, increasing the allostatic load and potentially leading to sympathetically driven behavioral
  responses like aggression. The initially adaptive stress response, over time, becomes maladaptive
  and increases the risk that the child will develop physical or psychological health issues (Erath, El-
  Sheikh, and Cummings 2009; Hinnant, Erath, and El-Sheikh 2015; Krishnakumar and Buehler 2000).
  All of this can happen even with the ANS working within its reciprocal range. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk3gqce7hkc0p952yc3p43me))
- Foundational dysregulation makes it difficult to regulate responses and interactions, in part because
  the physiology does not support social engagement, connection, or perception of safety. In fact, the
  responses of the physiology often signal threat or danger—and this is likely happening almost
  continuously. Lack of regulation causes more extreme responses to frightening experiences (and
  causes more experiences to be perceived as frightening), causing the amygdala and hippocampus to
  give higher “value” to those memories and response patterns, essentially creating neurochemical
  memory markers that make those memories more potent and long-lasting (Janak and Tye 2015). When
  we then access our memories and their affiliated lessons about past experiences, we effectively
  “find” more information about threat, which can then reconfirm the idea that our environment is
  dangerous. We then enter the self-fulfilling loop in which our dysregulation signals threat, our
  memory of past experiences confirms that a threat is indeed present, and our threat response kicks into
  gear. At this point, others are likely to respond as if they too are threatened. Friends or family
  members may adopt defensive or conflict-oriented postures in reaction to us, only confirming our
  feeling of being attacked or threatened, when it was truly our own behavior that provoked the
  defensive response in the first place. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk3k9rhsca05das9sfcfvq29))
- In effect, we may be filtering our environment without awareness of it, giving more weight and
  attention to the smallest possible indicators of threat (or lack of safety) (Janak and Tye 2015). If this
  has been happening since we were very young, our neuroception becomes “miscalibrated,” tuned
  much more acutely toward perception of threat than perception of safety, even when safety is
  available. We feel constantly under threat, and we respond accordingly—perhaps with aggression—
  and those around us react to our aggression and confirm our experience of being under threat. Or we
  drop into freeze mode and become numb to or dismissive of offers of connection and support, which
  is soon withdrawn because we failed to embrace it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk3kadkyzghqsg4ffe8pt14n))
- Survival physiology brings urgency and extinguishes curiosity and creativit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4ddw4rv70qy3yxye49fg61))
- None of these extreme physiological responses are compatible with logical thought, social
  connectedness, or a balanced response to our environment and others in it. We are instead driven to
  act in self-protective ways to resolve the immediate survival challenge. If we’ve had a healthy
  beginning, these survival responses will likely be time-limited and happen congruently within the
  context of the actual survival threat. Our level of response is likely to be well matched, more or less,
  to the true level of threat. Once the survival task has been accomplished, or we realize that our
  survival was not in fact under threat, we will return to a balanced physiological state that will
  support activities other than survival.
  Porges describes it this way:
  To effectively switch from defensive to social engagement strategies, the mammalian nervous
  system needs to perform two important adaptive tasks: (1) assess risk, and (2) if the environment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk3kvk064n1zn2e2yzfn6evf))
- is perceived as safe, inhibit the more primitive limbic structures that control fight, flight, or freeze
  behaviors. Any stimulus that has the potential for increasing an organism’s experience of safety
  has the potential of recruiting the evolutionarily more advanced neural circuits that support the
  prosocial behaviors of the social engagement system. (Porges 2009, 88) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk3kvqam35g6mm0rrk41a6ra))
- If, on the other hand, we have not had reliable access to safety, we may not be able to perform the
  adaptive tasks of accurately assessing risk or perceiving safety in the environment. Our survival
  physiology may operate as a chronic background state (or filter) for everything we do and experience.
  We will be more easily catapulted into the urgency of survival effort, and our physiology will
  respond as if extreme threat is present. We will be more likely to overrespond ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk3kxghs1cayr5wjm8h5dw36))
- Those with a strong internal locus of control tend to believe they’re able to influence the outcome
  of their experiences, take responsibility for their actions, and take less interest in the opinions of
  others. They also tend to be high achievers, and attribute negative outcomes to their own failings.
  Those with a strong external locus of control tend to believe that life is controlled by others, or by
  external elements they cannot influence, such as fate or luck, and tend to blame others for what
  happens in their lives. They may also have a stronger sense of faith in letting outcomes rest in the
  hands of other ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk3kzjd78fbf1vpz0cxrw6qk))
- We will create compensating mechanisms and do our best to manage the overwhelming experiences that result when dysregulation and lack of safety are severe. We will develop somatic and physiological strategies, as well as sometimes elaborate behavioral and belief systems, to substitute for genuine regulation.
  Rather than some of the terminology more typically used, such as Bernard Brandchaft’s
  “pathological accommodation” (Brandchaft 2007), we prefer the term “defensive accommodation” for these management strategies. When we refer to the management of overwhelming experience, we include not only behavioral but also somatic maladaptations used as survival responses to developmental trauma. Most other models of accommodation address primarily psychological and behavioral responses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4dn7hneyczd68wdk8gqme7))
- This is seen as originating with the child’s attempt to protect himself from “intolerable pain and existential anxiety” (Brandchaft 2007, 667) when parents do not provide access to regulation, and instead demand that the child respond to their (the parents’) needs. That is, the parents’ own insecure attachment, or lack of self-regulation, prevents them from offering co-regulation to the child, and instead demands that the child respond to and attempt to compensate for these deficiencies. This is, of course, usually driven by subconscious needs and impulses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4dq7pa1jjjvgvmpv83z0zc))
- Brandchaft (2007) uses the term “pathological accommodation” to describe the deep-seated form
  of accommodation that develops in the face of early trauma. This form of accommodation, according to Brandchaft, includes all the ways we might unconsciously take on the beliefs and feelings of another, while giving up our own experiences, in order to preserve connection and attachment bonds that have been traumatically threatened. This is seen as originating with the child’s attempt to protect himself from “intolerable pain and existential anxiety” (Brandchaft 2007, 667) when parents do not provide access to regulation, and instead demand that the child respond to their (the parents’) needs. That is, the parents’ own insecure attachment, or lack of self-regulation, prevents them from offering co-regulation to the child, and instead demands that the child respond to and attempt to compensate for these deficiencies. This is, of course, usually driven by subconscious needs and impulses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4dsnmph5h78r04kxzqxje4))
- “There is a basic conflation here,” Brandchaft writes, “in that no distinction is drawn between compulsive attitudes of accommodative submission and voluntary wishes to please, and these are being indiscriminately regarded as characteristic of ‘love.’ Accommodation out of love, with a respect for the legitimate needs of one’s partner, is the successful outcome of healthy development and remains the sine qua non of any wholesome relationship. Pathological accommodation shows the continuing influence of traumatic developmental attachment experience and is marked by its essentially compulsive quality” (Brandchaft 2007, 670).

- Developmental trauma can make even the most basic needs, like being cared for and nurtured, seem outside of normal experience, and their absence is indeed life-threatening. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4e7ar2mn7yr1mpsg55r67m))
- the
  trauma literally imprints on the patterning of neurons, creating a template for the neural systems that provide a frame of reference for future experiences. Compare that to traumatic experiences in adults, who already possess a supportive neural system—the trauma may alter that system, but a strong foundational architecture is already in place. Trauma typically will not undo years of neural patterning. It will disrupt that patterning, but a healthy foundation built during infancy, childhood, and the teen years has created something like a sturdy table.

- Developmental trauma does not have the same impact on all children and adults. The two primary responses to developmental trauma in children are hyperarousal response or dissociative response, and the majority will utilize both. Descriptive terms like “oppositional,” “defiant,” “distant,” “acting out,” and “resistant” are often used to describe the fearful adult or child. These types of behaviors tend to anger, frustrate, or mystify others and bring about greater separation for the adult or child who deploys these behaviors, which produces the opposite of the desired result. These behaviors can be difficult to understand, as the child may be overreading the nonverbal cues of angry adults, and this can move her toward a more primitive or disorganized state in her behaviors and responses.

  physiology, which are different from other forms of trauma, and how ongoing experiences of survival effort create symptoms and disrupt the ability of clients to respond with ease and spontaneity to life challenges, ultimately compromising resilience.

- It’s important to note that reading the questions on the test or filling out the questionnaire can cause
  distress. We encourage readers to attend to their responses and discontinue taking the questionnaire if they find themselves disturbed by it.
  The ten adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) included in the questionnaire measure whether or
  not someone has experienced any of the listed conditions in a household prior to age eighteen. Even though the age range exceeds the range used for the definition for developmental trauma (which is trauma that occurs prior to age five), we feel that, overall, this study has yielded important information about long-term outcomes for our clien ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4er7qkhwyec481yzrjpbrm))
- Once children reach adulthood, they can flee their environments and put themselves in places
  where they no longer face actual threats, but having spent so many years of childhood feeling unsafe, the traumatized physiology is now primed to move toward self-protection; it will lean in that direction even without much in the way of a trigger. Something as fleeting as a stray thought might provoke such a response, causing the heart to race and a sudden urge to flee. This can cascade into freeze mode, where an individual can no longer think, rationalize, or respond. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4ew67n0k2c4w5bj54t7e7s))
- interoception (perception of our inner somatic experience, which informs our experience
  of self) is also disrupted—tuned more toward survival-oriented information and limiting our ability to notice more subtle states that may be affiliated with well-being and pleasure. This could mean that a client is deriving unusual or unexpected meaning from normal sensations and may be unable to accurately report what she feels. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4ex31tdbh53k9cxbnrpxak))
- Window of Tolerance as the zone where we effectively process environmental signals without becoming too reactive or too withdrawn, given the circumstances. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnst607s8v9ch319c3nw7jj))
- When we slip outside of the Window of Tolerance and into survival physiology, the subcortical
  regions of the brain become more dominant, inhibiting our access to the executive function of the prefrontal cortex. We are more likely to be overpowered by our own survival responses, losing access to the more rational and logical thought processes that are mediated by the cortical regions of our brain.
  One possible goal of therapy for the trauma survivor is to expand his Window of Tolerance,
  increasing his capacity to respond to greater and greater challenges and stimulation, while remaining within a range of self-awareness and regulation that does not provoke survival physiology. This capacity would arise from an increase in the client’s access to healthier self-regulation and a greater felt sense of safety. Often this is initially accomplished by exposing the client to various tools that assist with self-regulation and self-soothing. Later in this chapter, we will discuss other ways the clinician can support expansion of the client’s Window of Tolerance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnsx3ndqs8edvvhzvebskm9))
- Those with an internal locus of control believe strongly that they are responsible for their choices
  and, ultimately, that they are responsible for their own sense of reward or accomplishment and the interpretation of events—known as “reinforcements” in the locus of control model. Those with this mindset see themselves as the captains of their own ships. They look inward for responses to situations and experiences, and allocate responsibility to themselves (rather than others or random circumstances) for their successes and failures in life.

- We can also draw a correlation here between internal/external locus of control and
  anxious/avoidant attachment styles.

- The person with an anxious attachment style is more likely to rely on the other person in the relationship to provide comfort and a sense of security, and may even expect that person to function as his source of regulation. In the absence of a direct sense of connection with that person, those with an anxious attachment style are more likely to feel unable to manage their own responses ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqnt8rqbdzsc1b07y6mtq3tx))
- The model of the Faux Window provides a representation of what occurs when someone is chronically outside of his Window of Tolerance, and has developed defensive accommodations that effectively provide him with the experience of being within his Optimal Arousal Zone—when, in fact, he is operating chronically outside of that zone.

- The model of the Faux Window provides a representation of what occurs when someone is chronically outside of his Window of Tolerance, and has developed defensive accommodations that effectively provide him with the experience of being within his Optimal Arousal Zone—when, in fact, he is operating chronically outside of that zone.
  In this representation, in figure 11, the Window of Tolerance is shown as being narrowed, making
  it very challenging for the client to stay within that window once any sort of stimulus appears. This is what typically occurs in the face of developmental trauma. The chronic dysregulation that commonly accompanies early trauma usually forces this narrowing of the Optimal Arousal Zone to the point that almost anything bringing challenge to the system will push someone over the threshold of the window. In figure 11, we can see how this would occur with chronic hyper-arousal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqntc31wk2gfzqt96e0hsmve))
- Many clients who have experienced developmental trauma have never fully developed a Window of Tolerance—they chronically operate beyond their threshold of regulation. Because they don’t have access to genuine self-regulation, they will come as close as they can by applying defensive accommodations.

- Jerry used denial and substances as defensive accommodations. During his younger life, he used medications as an artificial parasympathetic brake for his sympathetic arousal. He rarely had the experience of his parasympathetic response coming on naturally—his ANS was out of sync with itself. Jerry blamed others for his problems, but desperately wanted to be accepted and loved by his family. He had never experienced a natural Window of Tolerance, but existed only in a Faux Window. This Faux Window at one edge was dark and quiet, and, at the other, filled with anger and rage. He used substances to manipulate his regulation within the Faux Window.
  With his lack of access to co-regulation and soothing during his first weeks of life, Jerry’s physiology tuned more toward overuse of the dorsal conservation physiology. Once home with his family, his quietness was misinterpreted as his being a “good” baby who never cried. Because his mother was already overwhelmed with child care, she felt relief at having a baby who seemed to need so little from her.

- ather than considering what we may need to add, we more likely must consider what should be reduced or removed to decrease overstimulation and diminish the need for defensive accommodations. In such cases, we need to limit the interventions we use to those that help the client remain within his Window of Tolerance, and reduce how frequently we provoke the need for defensive accommodations.
  At the same time, we should also provide support to increase the capacity for self-regulation,
  which will in turn expand the Window of Tolerance, thereby reducing the need for defensive accommodations. We will discuss the support for regulation more fully in subsequent chapters ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr07hpyp27tvfzxwsjt9v8s7))
