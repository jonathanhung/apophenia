- It is telling how much of modern ‘development’ has been and continues to be obsessed with ‘ease’, ‘convenience’, ‘standardization’ (in both so-called ‘developing’ and so-called ‘developed’ countries), with stamping out the ‘crookedness’ inherent to the vernacular and replacing it with the industrial, pre-fabricated, ready-made, ultra-processed et al. (in food and farming, building, tools, learning, clothing/textiles, among others). Some of the genesis of this is chronicled in Elizabeth Shove’s fascinating work, like her book Comfort, Cleanliness and Convenience: The Social Organization of Normality, showing how very constructed (usually by powerful interests) our notions of intolerable 'crookedness' are. James C. Scott’s work is also highly relevant here, esp Seeing Like a State, where he uses the term ‘legibility’ to describe the condition sought to be imposed on society and nature alike by (in his case) totalising, modernist states (one might add, also if not more so by commercial interests like corporations), and the converse condition, the “illegible”, characterizes the local, particular, vernacular, organic, crooked – benighted conditions to be eradicated whether in the case of forestry, names, city planning, agriculture, etc. “Centrally managed social plans misfire, Scott argues, when they impose schematic visions that do violence to complex interdependencies that are not – and cannot – be fully understood.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcv9ws5y63hacnfxsrma83n4))
- This brings us full-circle back to Hartmut Rosa’s themes of resonance and controllability/uncontrollability. “The driving cultural force of that form of life we call ‘modern’ is the desire to make the world controllable. Yet it is only in encountering the uncontrollable that we really experience the world – only then do we feel touched, moved and alive. A world that is fully known, in which everything has been planned and mastered, would be a dead world.” One could substitute, “A world that is fully straightened, where all crookedness has been eradicated, would be a dead world.” Sliver of hope: however much a ready-made un-crooked world has been imposed on us, I see an irrepressible interest in the hand-made, the bespoke, the vernacular, which again is unsurprising since it testifies to a basic human, animal need.
