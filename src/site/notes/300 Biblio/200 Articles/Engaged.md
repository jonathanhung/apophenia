- a program built on behavior change would provide more structured guidance to match people to goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsvzqps5hss12djdxkcvzn4))
- Behavior change design is the application of psychological methods and research to the development of products, services, or experiences. Almost everything designers make has some behavior change built into it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfsw2sx4wc5s8zyg4amkkg41))
- It’s easy to creep into dark patterns and manipulative design choices, if your goal in applying psychology is to keep someone within your product as long as possible without it being beneficial to them.1 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gftv14n9vywn37whfvs87v7q))
- Behavior change design works at two levels. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gftv9n7ehwrn69ft57b0ybpp))
- For products that are intended to change people’s behaviors, there is often a protocol built into the product itself. These protocols are step-by-step processes that outline the correct way to change a behavior based on previous research. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gftv9y7mm6ewy4pvzqn4fa8n))

- The second level at which behavior change design works is making the digital product itself engaging by aligning it with people’s motivational needs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gftvbvr115gjb8xeat8n7920))
    - Note: B benefits = motivational needs. Or nudges [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- People are different. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gftvqbshh29dwvq2sdwznj8s))
    - Note: Mean or extremes? Archetypes or behavioral principles [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- focus on behaviors over emotions and cognitions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gftvt1jxpaw1r69cdq5mhyfd))
- Every behavior change intervention has one or more target behaviors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gftvy8w8xxf66140qjm31441))
- Almost every other design decision cascades from that one, from the data that you’ll collect to the features you’ll include. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gftvyekt68f1hea6xkamxrew))
- Motivation can be defined as desire with velocity. The way most of us use the word in our daily lives isn’t quite right; people might say something like “I’m motivated to be rich,” but they aren’t really. They want to be rich. That’s just desire. Motivation, like behavior change design, takes a target behavior as an object. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gftvxnmjb6ecbgb1kya0501y))

- Basic Psychological Needs
  Yes, people are different from each other, but in some fundamental ways, they’re all the same. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfv2q01sysk1c9yyc4pqdj4p))
- The first basic psychological need is autonomy. Autonomy means having control and being able to make meaningful choices. Meaningful choices include which goals to pursue and, broadly, which methods to use to pursue them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfv2p8hfgfw87xncs6vpp8hp))
- The second basic psychological need is competence. Competence is supported when people can see that they’re learning or growing with time and activity. People thrive on progress. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfv2pk0c3bj3dfqs4sw1v6kq))
- The third basic psychological need is relatedness. Relatedness is satisfied when people feel part of something larger than themselves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfv2prjnceka3dr10n1sx3nv))
- needs are supported by an experience, the more people want to engage in it. Basically, support for these needs is what makes an experience fun, interesting, or fulfilling. Because people are hardwired to satisfy basic psychological needs, they are extremely sensitive to cues in the environment that either support or thwart them.
  The first basic psychological need is autonomy. Autonomy means having control and being able to make meaningful choices. Meaningful choices include which goals to pursue and, broadly, which methods to use to pursue them. Programs that dictate user goals are likely to feel less autonomy-supportive; similarly, programs that give users lots of choices that aren’t meaningful, like the color of a dashboard, won’t fill this need.
  The second basic psychological need is competence. Competence is supported when people can see that they’re learning or growing with time and activity. People thrive on progress. Regular, clear feedback helps people see what they’ve done. And designers can help ensure that people make progress by identifying the obstacles stopping them from success and creating ways for them to overcome those obstacles.
  The third basic psychological need is relatedness. Relatedness is satisfied when people feel part of something larger than themselves. Often, relatedness comes from one-on-one or small group relationships, but people can also get their relatedness fix from being part of a community, feeling connected to a higher power, or having an emotional bond with a pet. People are very good at creating connections, even with inanimate objects, so it’s possible to help fill their relatedness tank through technology alone.4 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfv2mppd1yjr0qxbbqem810q))
