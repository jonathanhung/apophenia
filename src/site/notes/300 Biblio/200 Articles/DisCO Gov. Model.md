## Highlights 
---
- The DisCO model is a substantially developed fork of the [Better Means Open Enterprise Governance Model](https://wiki.guerrillamediacollective.org/index.php/Open_Enterprise_Governance_Model_-_Original_Version) (OEGM). The adaptations have been made to:
  1. Bypass the original modelâ€™s start-up/for profit orientation
  2. benefit, commons-oriented market entities self sustain their social vision. while addressing their specific requirements and allow for future modifications.
  3. Shift the focus from technical, protocol-based solutions to relations, trust and care work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6qdb1japss0bvrcg2prakk0))
