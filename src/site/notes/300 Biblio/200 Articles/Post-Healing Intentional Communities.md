- **Healing** is when we become conscious of that which was previously unconscious and seek transformation to rewrite old narratives and learn tools and processes to more actively engage with that which arises before it harms ourselves and others. Often this process involves making “healing” part of our new identity. We dare to go deeply into our “wounds” in order to understand them as fully and wholly as possible, which can simultaneously be extraordinarily painful and exquisitely liberating. The healing journey almost always involves a great deal of grief, surrender and forgiveness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9etdkjavg1xpg5shgt6amzz))
- Generally, I see three paths that people take when they transition or stabilize in Post-Healing:
  1. **Stay Put and Serve:** Turn around and help a lending hand by serving others on their Healing Journeys in the very community(ies) that helped enable one to enter the Post-Healing phase of life. Often this looks like becoming a workshop facilitator, spiritual teacher, health practitioner, or a counselor/coach/therapist/guide.
  2. **Return Home:** Sometimes one must consciously leave the very communities that helped them heal in order to break free of their old ways of being, marking a clear start of a new chapter in a new land. This can involve returning to a familiar place, perhaps somewhere they once called home, entering from a new foundation of psychological health and spiritual awakening that grounds their souls in service of those who may largely be operating from a Pre-Healing or Healing orientation. Sometimes this can even look like returning to our old careers or the lives we temporarily left behind, though doing so from a new psycho-spiritual foundation.
  3. **Pioneer a New Direction:** A third path I often see are those who leave their healing communities with the mission of bringing to life something that’s never been created before, often deeply rooted in a vision that feels infused with soul and spirit, as if it’s larger than any one being yet coming through the vessels of specific individuals holding the torch of this Dream.

- Post-Healing is more about having the capacities, tools and inner-stability to responsibly weather the storms of healing when they inevitably arise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9etfkr3n4byy11t64c0d8p5))
- here’s moments when nothing dramatic on the “outside” is happening, but internally our world is crumbling: depression, addiction, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, burnout.
  However healing finds us, it could be said we have a choice: dive in or shut it out. In reality, life is far more nuanced, and often there’s a greater intelligence at work that dials in these two simultaneously, journeying into parts of our shipwrecked soul and shutting out vast amounts of that which we’re not ready to explore, or would be unwise to do so.

- Tucker, all your ‘innerwork’ has gone from sacred to indulgent, and in order for deeper layers of healing to occur you need to move past the idea of ‘healing’ itself. There’s nothing wrong with you, Tucker, other than the stories you tell yourself about something being wrong with you, but even those aren’t wrong, they are just Love guiding you, just like everything else in existence. It’s all Love guiding you. Don’t try to change anything, including not trying to change not changing anything. You’re making this whole thing up anyways, which also means it’s entirely real. The point is, relax. Allow Love to just be here, now, however it shows up. And know that you are always being of service, so drop these stories about needing to be Jesus or Ghandi before you can be ‘good.’ And then drop the story that you need to drop the stories. Rest in silence and listen to the noise. Be stillness in motion. It’s simple. That’s why it’s complicated. Do you get it? Good, you’re not supposed to. Have fun, my friend!” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9etkj1hkdarhmpaavwt9dps))
- It was like a blank canvas called Life was lovingly staring at me with its invisible eyes saying, *“If life is but a Dream, what dream do you want to dream?”*
  The first image my soul painted on this no-longer-blank canvas was fatherhood. I dream to be a dad ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9etnbdxvkk08zfbzvqr532e))
- My dream is to raise my family in an intentional community that shares the essence of the ones that raised me anew as I re-entered Life from a Post-Healing orientation of Love Is Always Here. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9etr4kze3d9dd1e13gtty0h))
- What if we looked at all of Life as constantly in a state of Birth Daying? Could we continuously show up with overflowing cups of love as we celebrate, serve and surrender to the beauty of Birth and the inevitability of always-present Death?
  Can we take no moment for granted, including the moments that we take for granted?
  Is this vision Utopian? Do you want it to be? If you want it to be, then it can be, and then it will seem far away and always out of reach. That is your choice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9evdwkhk451mrp1jhyg3jjr))
