- Decentralization as credible fairness
  Sometimes, DAOs' primary concern is not a need to *resist* nation states, but rather a need to *take on some of the functions* of nation states. This often involves tasks that can be described as "maintaining basic infrastructure". Because governments have less ability to oversee DAOs, DAOs need to be structured to take on a greater ability to oversee *themselves*. And this requires decentralization.

  *Of course, it's not actually possible to come anywhere close to eliminating hierarchy and inequality of information and decision-making power in its entirety etc etc etc, but what if we can get even 30% of the way there?*
  Consider three motivating examples: algorithmic stablecoins, the [Kleros court](https://kleros.io/), and the [Optimism retroactive funding mechanism](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c).
  • **An algorithmic stablecoin DAO** is a system that uses on-chain financial contracts to create a crypto-asset whose price tracks some stable index, often but not necessarily the US dollar.
  • **Kleros is a "[decentralized court](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4gigyd/decentralized_court/)"**: a DAO whose function is to give rulings on arbitration questions such as "is this Github commit an acceptable submission to this on-chain bounty?"
  • **Optimism's retroactive funding mechanism** is a component of the [Optimism DAO](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/) which retroactively rewards projects that have provided value to the Ethereum and Optimism ecosystems.
  In all three cases, there is a need to make subjective judgements, which cannot be done automatically through a piece of on-chain code. In the first case, the goal is simply to get reasonably accurate measurements of some price index. If the stablecoin tracks the US dollar, then you just need the ETH/USD price. If hyperinflation or some other reason to abandon the US dollar arises, the stablecoin DAO might need to manage a trustworthy on-chain CPI calculation. Kleros is all about making unavoidably subjective judgements on any arbitrary question that is submitted to it, including whether or not submitted questions should be [rejected for being "unethical"](https://snapshot.org/#/kleros.eth/proposal/QmeJjVUgF2o9vrmjx8szvher8Ca6iR2TuTwHGR9KbM1gC9). Optimism's retroactive funding is tasked with one of the most open-ended subjective questions at all: what projects have done work that is the most useful to the Ethereum and Optimism ecosystems?
  All three cases have an unavoidable need for "governance", and pretty robust governance too. In all cases, governance being attackable, from the outside or the inside, can easily lead to very big problems. Finally, the governance doesn't just need to *be* robust, it needs to *credibly convince* a large and untrusting public that it is robust.
