## Highlights

- I'd argue it would be impossible to actually eliminate cyberloafing - which isn't a problem anyway - because people inherently need breaks to let them be productive when they are working.
- This is a dysfunctional view of work on three levels:
  Management is not being good the same thing as being at your job.
  We incentivize management as a control mechanism rather than a motivational and organizational mechanism in an organization, meaning that most middle managers are glorified cops.
  Middle managers are often graded on the work of their team, which means that they are actively incentivized to steal work and do little of their own.
