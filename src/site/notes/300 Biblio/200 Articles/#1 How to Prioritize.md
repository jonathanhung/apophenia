- My team doesn’t have fleshed out, long-term roadmaps, at least not in the sense that you’ve probably seen. And we’re better for it.
  The project that we’re working on a long one. It has a clear-enough articulated goal (although nobody can agree on what “done” means), but it’s long, years long. There are tons of unknown unknowns. There are almost an infinite number of permutations we could sequence the work in. It's a high priority for the company, it has a lot of stakeholders, and it’s also time-sensitive.
  From the beginning, we’ve had to make some really deliberate choices about how we work, what we work on, and how we prioritize. Doing this intentionally has surfaced some heuristics for how we prioritize that I think are broadly applicable to building software in general ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj3qya7y2tfqy26kw3hh0e6s))
- When presented with an unbounded choice about what to decide to do now vs later (or not at all), our team has had good results when optimizing for a couple of things:
  • We prioritize work that will allow us to learn more about the work that we think we’re going to do in the future
  • We prioritize work that will allow us to validate our future work more quickly (aka shortening our feedback loop)
  • We prioritize work that will allow us to move more safely
  • Sometimes, we prioritize work that’s easy and impactful to do first
  • Sometimes, we prioritize work that is truly time-sensitive. The reason this is a “sometimes” is not because we only sometimes complete work on-time that is time-sensitive, but because there are rather few actual time-sensitive pieces of software in this world. That’s a post for another day.
  • And then, we prioritize the work that we’ve spent time making easy, safe, and easier to validate. All other things equal, we use impact as a metric. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj3qzhar8h2mt07rqa8g2hb9))
