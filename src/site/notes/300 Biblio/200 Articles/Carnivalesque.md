- The primary act of carnival is the mock crowning and subsequent de-crowning of a carnival king. It is a "dualistic ambivalent ritual" that typifies the inside-out world of carnival and the "joyful relativity of all structure and order".[[3\|3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivalesque#cite_note-3) The act sanctifies ambivalence toward that which is normally considered absolute, single, monolithic.

- Characteristic of these genres are "multi-toned narration, the mixing of high and low, serious and comic; the use of inserted genres â€“ letters, found manuscripts, retold dialogues, parodies on the high genres... a mixing of prosaic and poetic speech, living dialects and jargons..."[[12\|12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivalesque#cite_note-12) Thus in the ancient seriocomic genres, language was not merely that which represents, but itself became an object of representation.[[13\|13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivalesque#cite_note-13) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcbgdp2054x3728r23qmn4t2))
- The dialogic sense of truth, the device of the *extraordinary situation*, the unencumbered frankness of speech, the clash of extreme positions and embodied ideas over ultimate questions, the technique of *anacrisis*, "threshold" dialogues in extreme or fantastic situations: present in Menippean satire, these qualities are given a new and more profound life in Dostoevsky's polyphonic novel.
