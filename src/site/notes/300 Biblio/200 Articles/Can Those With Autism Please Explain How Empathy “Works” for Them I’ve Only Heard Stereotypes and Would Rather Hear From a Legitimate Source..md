- If you approach an autistic person because you want to talk, you must tell them that you don't want suggestions or advice and you just want them to listen (and to interpret every question as rhetorical unless otherwise specified). It is perceived as not being empathetic, but the autistic person is expressing their concern and empathy by helping you solve this problem. This is what they will think you have approached them for.

- This is why I do my best to use the phrase, "Do you want my advice or do you want me to just listen?" I feel awkward just listening to someone; "Do I have the right expression?"; "How am I supposed to feel?"; "Does this person need comfort & if so, in what way?"
  If I can't offer a solution or let them know I relate, I feel awkward unless I'm told they just needed someone to vent to. Haha This is even more perturbing in a text for me because I'm never *exactly* certain how to respond in a way that's acknowledging without being overbearing or providing advice ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn658zn3xc26sy6hbxrj7r1b))
