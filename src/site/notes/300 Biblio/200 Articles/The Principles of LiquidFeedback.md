- Democracy and decision-making is not just about voting but also needs a discussion process to allow participants to form opin- ions. The ability to express opinions and to debate them is an integral part of democracy, as knowledge about arguments and counter-arguments is the basis of reasonable decision-making. But “reasonability” is subjective and depends on the will of the participants. In order to provide a fair process for decision- making that scales with several thousand or more participants, LiquidFeedback employs a structured discussion where it is not possible for every participant to reply to any contribution.
