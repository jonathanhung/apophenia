- What they were doing was part of a whole worldview, a whole understanding of “We have to set off these firecrackers, otherwise, the ghosts are going to inhabit our new business. We have to parade the temple Gods through the streets so that we will have good luck.” It was just as serious as people today going through the ritual of hand washing to protect themselves from invisible spirits that they call viruses. People in our society don't think of that as a ritual because it makes sense in their reality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrby0s6wb15b0dm6q2gkdz3))
- And so, we're facing a time where we're losing faith in what we thought was real, in the meanings we made about the world. We're losing faith in our stories. Now finally, we’re realizing, “Oh, those were just stories, those didn't really work. We were just washing our hands to comfort ourselves. We were signing these documents to feel safe.” That’s another ritual that is starting to become obsolete. It used to be a matter of great gravity to sign something, to put your sacred mark on an agreement. And now, multiple times a day, we click, “I agree.” It's become more and more obviously a “ritual.” And that means that the whole system of law, which is a system of magic in a way, is also losing its potency. And so just to circle back to your question, what are we going to do? It's not the right question: what are we going to do to replace that? As if we can design something and make ourselves believe in it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrbys6q0cvvrt9jq5tj8xph))
- So whatever the new culture is, it's not something that we design. That’s already wrong. If you're designing it, it's not a culture. It's still like, well, I designed this. It's not reality itself. It's just something I said, but what will emerge through getting honest with ourselves and accepting what is resonant with who we are becoming as we exit the state of being that corresponds to the old culture. That's how the new culture emerges. Does that make sense? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrc143ykfmcfvpav4phy6vw))
- the tool that is deconstructing the stories that are no longer resonant is the same tool that we're then trying to use to create new stories. But then we've already created an abstraction of the idea of the story. So there's always going to be this ironic distance between ourselves and the new story that we create. And then we're enacting this performance of the ritual, this performance of the new culture, as opposed to actually doing it. But it seems inevitable that we would have to go through some aspect of that process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrcb7a5mgsy00n0bbvww0ht))
- is entire day was suffused with little prayers. Like there was a prayer for getting up in the morning, a prayer for getting out of bed, a prayer for opening the door for the first time, a prayer for opening the window, for crossing the threshold, for getting in your boat. There was a prayer for breaking bread. Every significant act of the day was accompanied by a prayer. And it certainly wasn't coming from a place of, “Well, reality’s gotten really meaningless so we better make some rituals and prayers to bring meaning back into life.” It was that he was in actual communion with all kinds of spirits, presences that were real to him.

- In a way, all these attempts to design the next culture, they are very much the old culture.
  The idea of designing a culture. What other human beings have thought in those terms besides the modern?
  I mean, Plato, actually. But he's the forebear of modernity, who talked about designing a society.
  It's the idea that reality can be designed. We can design things within reality. Of course, we design things all the time. Design is not a dumb concept. But the idea that there are no limits to what we can design, that everything can be brought under the umbrella of design, and that that represents human progress, is one of the defining myths of modernity. It's the myth of conquest. And extending that mentality to spiritual or cultural realms is an extension of it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrkg150nm7w1jcr4nwve1s7))
- The vocabulary, the conceptual vocabulary of that collection of adjacent realities generates what from one perspective might look like rituals. I'm still taking these pills and putting them in my mouth. That's obviously a ritual, taking these magic tablets with the superstitious belief that that's going to make my teeth feel better or give me more energy or something. It’s absolute, out-and-out superstition. There's part of me that recognizes that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrce5vrgq2xb9nx1wmrx4df))

- What I'm talking about is the process of formation of new rituals. You can't extract them from their context and import them. You can't just descend into chaos either. But necessarily, there has to be a moment of real chaos after the dissolving of the old set of rituals. You cannot jump straight into new stories, new mythologies, new rituals. There has to be pandemonium. There has to be a dissolution of all the meanings. The old story has to die before the new one can be born. And there's always a place of latency, the space between stories. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrdjd01t4gvcsnwtnhk6k4w))
- Life knows what to do. All of the things that we might categorize as a mistake, all these futile attempts to make a new culture, those aren't even mistakes. The mistakes are not mistakes. They won’t achieve what they intend to achieve, but they are part of the process of that thing that we yearn for, that we call for, coming to us, moving through us, that we do not know how to achieve.

- It's like a baby being born. Imagine you’re a baby being born. “Okay, what do I have to do?” A tremendous process is underway, you’re being ejected from the womb, your whole world is falling apart, you’re getting pushed and stretched and squeezed. What's going on here? Tell me, what do I do? How do I make this happen? How do I make this work? I can't just react, right? I need to do something.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrdppx55mfvzkddf4cwq2sb))
- our experience of longing for a new culture is us experiencing the contractions. I think that's how it would relate to this metaphor. Because it feels so visceral. I feel a visceral desire to experience a culture that is different than the one we have. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrdq410n0kwjpnw6hr77bx1))
- It's like stepping off a ledge and you don't know if the bottom is six inches or 600 feet beneath you. When you land in the water, you realize that there was never actually any danger. But you cannot know that beforehand. In fact, it is necessary that it *seem* dangerous before you take the step into the unknown. And in a sense, it *is* dangerous. Because the unfamiliar world corresponds to unfamiliar parts of yourself. In other words, you will change. Change is a form of death. There's a letting go. You get to decide when you're ready to let go. And you will not be punished for holding on longer or shorter than somebody might believe you should. The world is not a test. Your power to create through attention is infinite. It's a choice, a pure choice. Who shall I become? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrkrjc3term3fdzxhdwry74))
- Eventually we we get to these moments where the situation gets so intense that we're just trying to survive these struggles. People are struggling. It's the sum total of these struggles that creates a new culture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrdvrb5r443pc6bcvhqdrr9))

  **Benjamin Life**  
  Don't you think that the collapse of the biosphere is some degree of a test though? It's testing the limits of how long that denial can occur before a scale of destruction that we've never experienced before occurs.
  **Charles Eisenstein**  
  Nope. If that were the case, we’d have already changed. We're already deep, deep into a level of destruction that is unprecedented. And we just have gotten used to it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbre1p1kg8z9pw095fwrj76p))
- That's what makes the new rituals feel real. They’re not just rituals, because they are your response to the world based on new knowledge. So they seem rational. They don't seem like rituals. If you develop your sensitivity and your attention and you start to perceive nature spirits all around you, then you're going to act as if there were nature spirits all around you. And ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrkqzw29gx25vy3sgb7g7xn))
- Now imagine if you had said 100 years ago, we are creating a future in which you will not be able to go outside for four or five months of the year for more than a minute. Would you put up with that? So no, the choice will never be taken from us. We'll always have the choice of directing our attention to the cry of life and its desire to live. And do we let that in? Do we let in the pain that life feels at its diminishment? And the joy it feels at its fulfillment? Because when we do, when we pay attention to that, then the natural choices, the natural responses of our living bodies and our divine souls will change. You take in new information through the power of attention and it changes you as an automatic chooser. So that's the answer to the *how* question if there is indeed a *how*.

- if there's any takeaway from this conversation, it would be to really take ownership of your power of attention. And you can do that as an experiment to really take responsibility for that power. When you're with somebody, the next person you're with, just see what happens when you give them your full attention. And you experiment with “Where do I put my attention?” What am I really listening to when they're talking? In what ways am I tuning them out? What ways am I filtering their presence through my ideas about them? And where am I going to put my attention right now? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbre57ztqc9tdkq521rnx96d))
