## Highlights

- What we’ve learned is that there is a language of the workplace, a lexicon that aligns with the culture of a place, and if you know that language and culture, you’re on the inside. If you don’t, you’re either taught it, or you’re forever on the outside, fumbling around, trying to figure out how to not screw up.

- For many young Black and Latinx tech professionals, molding to fit workplace culture ideals means stripping away elements of their identity that the dominant culture rejects as invalid or not meaningful. This involves a trade-off: How much of my identity do I need to perform or give away for validation and recognition from those in power? There are both practical and psychosocial implications to this trade-off. On one hand, identity performance and the pressure to assimilate operationally is draining, and chips away at an individual’s sense of self. On the other hand, if a Black and/or Latinx individual prioritizes self-preservation over performance and claims agency in making decisions around non-disruptive assimilation, they risk not fitting into the ill-defined yet dominant workplace culture.

- Secondly, recognizing where we have informal or formal authority and influence and choosing to extend that to newcomers, or even to longer-term team members who need the cover, is a bold way to include voices that are often unrecognized or devalued. Successfully navigating the workplace as a young professional often involves gaining informal access and support from more experienced or powerful team members. Extending power can look like inviting a more junior staff member to a high-level meeting that they typically wouldn’t attend, advocating that they be extended a stretch project and then mentoring them to success, or giving them extra time to process and talk through information before big meetings where they’re expected to perform on the spot.
