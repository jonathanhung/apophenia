- **§0.41** — The Bitcoin protocol is designed as a game. Incentives are built into its infrastructure. It only works when it is played. The distinctive feature of the Bitcoin game is that it produces binding decisions without a referee, or dependence upon prior agreement. Coordination is neither presumed, nor invoked, but produced. The absence of all superior authority makes Bitcoin *transcendental* in the philosophical sense, and adapts it to *anarchy* in the rigorous sense this term carries in the field of international relations theory ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7zd49dxzzfwnagv173k329f))
    - Note: incentives create spontaneous coordination [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Social analysis is a regional application of game-theory. There is no conception of ‘the social’ extricable from the domain of games. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7zd5wbf6xchs8qxz41abmpt))
- he presumption that any author – or indeed any sapient primate – can confidently lay claim to a zone of cognitive competence is already peculiarly reckless, and in fact *prima facie* implausible. Intellectual capability is an imitation game. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7zda02bzgxxcfw361w99w9t))
- *Any* statement here that appears as a claim to authority should be dismissed with a laugh. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7zdax8yc6hbnz4pna70c3fk))
- In Crypto-Current, ‘liberal’ is used consistently in its European, rather than its American sense. (Philosophical consistency is otherwise impossible.) It designates *the cause of the autonomous economy*, and thus the politics of screening private transactions from public consideration. By celebrated world-historic irony, this approaches the opposite of its dominant contemporary – and especially American – sense. ‘Left’ and ‘right’ are taken to be defined, respectively, by opposition to, and practical advocacy for, maximally-permissive capitalistic activity. Variation on the ideological spectrum – or *principal political dimension* (PPD) as it is called here – is thus articulated in broadly Marxian fashion, between (classical) liberal and socialistic poles.
