- In this quest to find a source of truth and enlightenment, pilgrims and searchers all over the world have at times taken on extreme risks and have not spared themselves from excruciating adventures.

- Once we stumble on a novel revelation, experience elevation, enter a presence that opens our heart and affords us a new awareness and perception about ourselves, or the nature of life and the universe, what do we then do? How do we work with this new opening so that it is not only a transitory state?
  Once a contact is made with a source that fills us with inspiration, awakens us in a whole new way and offers glimpses at the prospects of a higher perception, how do we process these experiences in ways that generate continual and embodied development?

- the early idealistic pioneers of the Internet, who brought postmodern do-no-evil redemptive tendencies, were quickly caught by the extraordinary profit opportunities it unlocked. This time, the extractive ethos moved from mining for natural resources in the ground to mining personal, psychological, and behavioral data in all of us. The last unconquered continent, the brain and unconscious mind, became the project of the most sophisticated labs in Silicon Valley.

- At core, the searcher’s quest for meaning and purpose carries the potential for human life to discover its own intrinsic noble nature.
  The socio-political and economic evolution to merit-based modern paradigm contained this nascent insight that every human is “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights", and ought to be given the opportunity of expressing and realizing their natural genius and higher potential ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9erjj6ndt6zzdbypcann2h1))
- our attraction to the people we admire is that we see in them elements of the noble human potential we know are latent in us, then, the wise teacher, the magical artist, the inspirational athlete, the compassionate healer, the charismatic leader, will reflect back to us what is latent inside us.

    - Note: our attraction to others we admire is seeing the fullness of the human staring back at us, the human we know exists in us. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]

- Celebri-tocracy is our postmodern way of disowning and refusing to take responsibility for our own creative, connective, and majestic power, as the birth right of becoming human. This too is some of the background scenery confronting any current postmodern or metamodern searcher of esoteric truth, higher communion, meaning, and purpose.
  Part of the challenge is how modernity has normalized this paradigm, including how we have been normalized to enjoy and acquiesce to an extreme fixation on consumption. Consuming is naturally part of living, but only a 20th century paradigmatic capture propagated the view of the human mainly as the “consumer,” largely leaving out the creative, life-giving, generative being the human can be.
