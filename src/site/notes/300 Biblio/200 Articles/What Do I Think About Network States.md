- Given that a purist "[private property rights only](https://mises.org/library/new-liberty-libertarian-manifesto)" libertarianism inevitably runs into large problems like its inability to fund public goods, any successful pro-freedom program in the 21st century has to be a hybrid containing at least one Big Compromise Idea that solves at least 80% of the problems, so that independent individual initiative can take care of the rest. This could be some stringent measures against economic power and wealth concentration (maybe charge annual [Harberger taxes](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=12668&context=journal_articles) on everything), it could be an 85% [Georgist land tax](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/does-georgism-work-is-land-really), it could be a UBI, it could be mandating that sufficiently large companies become democratic internally, or one of any other proposals. Not all of these work, but you need *something* that drastic to have any shot at all.
  Generally, I am used to the Big Compromise Idea being a leftist one: some form of equality and democracy. Balaji, on the other hand, has Big Compromise Ideas that feel more rightist: local communities with shared values, loyalty, religion, physical environments structured to encourage personal discipline ("keto kosher") and hard work. These values are implemented in a very libertarian and tech-forward way, organizing not around land, history, ethnicity and country, but around the cloud and personal choice, but they are rightist values nonetheless. This style of thinking is foreign to me, but I find it fascinating, and important. Stereotypical "[wealthy white liberals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baizuo)" ignore this at their peril: these more "traditional" values are actually quite popular even among [some ethnic minorities in the United States](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/us/politics/latino-voters-democrats.html), and even more so in places like Africa and India, which is exactly where Balaji is trying to build up his base.

- The "founder" thing
  Throughout the book, Balaji is insistent on the importance of "founders" in a network state (or rather, a *startup society*: you found a startup society, and become a network state if you are successful enough to get diplomatic recognition). Balaji explicitly describes startup society founders as being "moral entrepreneurs":
  > These presentations are similar to startup pitch decks. But as the founder of a startup society, you aren't a technology entrepreneur telling investors why this new innovation is better, faster, and cheaper. You are a moral entrepreneur telling potential future citizens about a better way of life, about a single thing that the broader world has gotten wrong that your community is setting right.
  Founders crystallize moral intuitions and [learnings from history](https://thenetworkstate.com/political-power-and-technological-truth) into a concrete philosophy, and people whose moral intuitions are compatible with that philosophy coalesce around the project.

- Reading *The Network State* reminded me of a different book that I read ten years ago: David de Ugarte's *[Phyles: Economic Democracy in the Twenty First Century](http://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Phyles)*. *Phyles* talks about similar ideas of transnational communities organized around values, but it has a much more left-leaning emphasis: it assumes that these communities will be democratic, inspired by a combination of 2000s-era online communities and nineteenth and twentieth-century ideas of cooperatives and workplace democracy.

- Ugarte's theory of formation. Since I've already spent a lot of time quoting Balaji, I'll give de Ugarte a fair hearing with a longer quote:
  > The very blogosphere is an ocean of identities and conversation in perpetual cross-breeding and change from among which the great social digestion periodically distils stable groups with their own contexts and specific knowledge.
  > 
  > These conversational communities which crystallise, after a certain point in their development, play the main roles in what we call digital Zionism: they start to precipitate into reality, to generate mutual knowledge among their members, which makes them more identitarially important to them than the traditional imaginaries of the imagined communities to which they are supposed to belong (nation, class, congregation, etc.) as if it were a real community (group of friends, family, guild, etc.)
  > 
  > Some of these conversational networks, identitarian and dense, start to generate their own economic metabolism, and with it a distinct demos – maybe several demoi – which takes the nurturing of the autonomy of the community itself as its own goal. These are what we call Neo-Venetianist networks. Born in the blogosphere, they are heirs to the hacker work ethic, and move in the conceptual world, which tends to the economic democracy which we spoke about in the first part of this book.
  > 
  > Unlike traditional cooperativism, as they do not spring from real proximity-based communities, their local ties do not generate identity. In the Indianos' foundation, for instance, there are residents in two countries and three autonomous regions, who started out with two companies founded hundreds of kilometres away from each other.
  We see some very Balajian ideas: shared collective identities, but formed around values rather than geography, that start off as discussion communities in the cloud but then materialize into taking over large portions of economic life. De Ugarte even uses the exact same metaphor ("digital Zionism") that Balaji does!
  But we also see a key difference: there is no single founder. Rather than a startup society being formed by an act of a single individual combining together intuitions and strands of thought into a coherent formally documented philosophy, a phyle starts off as a conversational network in the blogosphere, and then directly turns into a group that does more and more over time - all while keeping its democratic and horizontal nature. The whole process is much more organic, and not at all guided by a single person's intention. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8m7qy79v3dxa90zshj03w8e))
