## Highlights

- Healthy boundaries are as much about social
  justice as interpersonal effectiveness. If we don’t have boundaries, we are as malleable as play-doh. And if we are malleable, we are controllable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj3rnzfr6z5ny6bape0x73c5))
- Instead, in modern culture, boundaries are more
  often defined by a lack of words or actions. Not talking about things sends the message that these things aren’t worth talking about. That they don’t matter. That what we want, need, and desire doesn’t matter. That who we are in relation to others doesn’t matter. And that seeps into all our other interactions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj3rshfgjrxkjd6jgs8me15b))
- boundaries change over time, across
  situations, and within different relationships ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj3ryygdaggra3xh1fpdkzed))

- Emotional-Relational Boundaries: Emotional-relational boundaries are not just about how we want to feel and how others want to feel. They are even more about demonstrating our respect for our own personhood and the personhood of others. We respect these boundaries through how we care for others and by letting them have their own emotional experiences. But also, they are about not taking responsibility for other people’s emotions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj3s11byxvwr2vmb58vnndvn))
- Permeable Boundaries are ones that everything gets through if it wants to. These boundaries are defined for you. Attacks come from the outside, and you don’t know how to hold your ground. So if I kept answering my phone when it rings late at night and having long, drawn-out conversations when I should be sleeping, my boundary around that is permeable. Meaning, I let people do whatever they want in a particular situation. Generally speaking, permeable boundaries is just code for “letting people walk all over you.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj3schvfgasy8nhxk7e00mw0))
- So we need to learn to firm up our boundaries, but baby bear style. Not too hard and not too soft. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj3sd88p2kbxbqx1bmq91nx8))
- What messages have you internalized about your right to healthy boundaries and the ownership of your individual needs? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj3sewnevxyxqqbpt714tqft))
- ’ve defined boundaries as the constructs that differentiate between ourselves and someone else. Boundary violations can occur when that space is not negotiated in conscious and mindful ways and
  our actions result in harm (regardless of our intentions). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj3sfj8yz1n28b3amz4dftnn))
- Consent is the informed, voluntary permission given or agreement reached for an activity/ exchange between two or more sentient beings. When it comes to the expression and negotiation of our boundaries, we generally do so through how we communicate consent. If someone asks you “Hey, can I borrow this book?” they are recognizing that the book is something you own (property boundary!), and are asking for your consent to use it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj3sg6aek23y1nm8k49prtj9))
- ’m including a long (exhausting, depressing, and
  somewhat overwhelming) list of examples of boundary
  violations on the following pages. This list is an important
  part of the discussion because so many of the systemic,
  cultural problems that fuck up our boundaries make it so
  we don’t often realize that boundaries are being violated
  right and left. That people are violating our boundaries and
  we are violating other people’s boundaries. And yes, we
  stomp all over our own boundaries when we de-center our
  own needs in order to appease others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj3z3sbvgx6n86de9v50q5wg))
- Sharing personal information about oneself without
  checking out if the hear-er wants to hear it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj44x8zcjcc4pya6046ek05y))
