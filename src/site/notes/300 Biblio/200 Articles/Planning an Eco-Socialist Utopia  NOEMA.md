- Despite the danger, the young professor insisted on being on the ice himself to see the convoys through these challenges. Kantorovich’s efforts brought thousands of tons of fuel, food and munitions into the city, and nearly 1.5 million civilians out of it. Adolf Hitler thought he could conquer Leningrad in six weeks; nearly 900 days later, the siege was lifted, and the humbled Wehrmacht retreated westwards. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153074))
- Kantorovich was hard at work on his masterpiece, “The Best Use of Economic Resources.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153082))
- The kernel of Neurath’s philosophical system was the rejection of “pseudorationality” — the belief that any single metric, like money, could guide all decisions within any system, economic or otherwise. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153097))
- Neurath extended this insight to socialist economics and argued that an alternative system based on a universal equivalent (labor time, for example) would also lack the necessary conscious control that could rationally and democratically weigh tradeoffs between the incommensurate ethical, social, environmental and aesthetic considerations that comprise any decision ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153099))
- linear programming marked a conceptual breakthrough in planning theory ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153104))
- offered a systematic way to allocate resources and thus optimize selected metrics of national well-being. That is, as soon as a planner could articulate the material constraints of an economy using mathematical language, plans of production and distribution could naturally follow without the aid of the market’s invisible hand ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153108))
- Neurath made clear that conscious control is a planned economy’s greatest strength compared to capitalism, but it requires democracy to prevent authoritarian and inefficient supervision over the production and distribution of goods. In this way, we could say that linear programming remained a doomed demi-utopian proposal as long as it was not integrated within a broader liberatory project. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153141))
- to micromanage every pound of coffee or piece of steel rebar around the globe, but to “construct a system of information, accounting, economic indices and stimuli which permit local decision-making organs to evaluate the advantage of their decisions from the point of view of the whole economy.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153156))
- Neurath called these various imagined futures “scientific utopias,” and saw them as foundational to economic democracy. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153159))
- Half-Earth socialism ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153174))
- even a wisely managed eco-socialist utopia would still be plagued by some inefficiencies and shortages ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153176))
- Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that combine physics, chemistry, biology and economics into a single simulation of the world for the next 300 or so years ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153185))
- variables such as pollution taxes, probabilities of technological breakthroughs, spatial patterns of agriculture and biofuels, global food demand, the makeup of energy systems and the sensitivity of the climate and biosphere to all these social changes ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153189))
- Pseudorationality has now given the illusion that climate change can be reduced to a simple algebra problem. Clearly, another kind of political economy — eco-socialism — is needed. This method should allow us to think in terms of trade-offs between discrete and incommensurate goals, much like Kantorovich’s calculations on Lake Ladoga, without money or other universal equivalents distorting global plans ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153195))
- too many modelers lack a political program that is able to realize the transformation they dream about ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153197))
- Although critics of the left often accuse socialists of magical thinking, the real fantasy is a future where capitalism is constrained within planetary boundaries. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153202))
- the authors worked with designer Son La Pham (Trust) and programmer Francis Tseng (Jain Family Institute) to design a video game (https://play.half.earth) where you can take on the role of a planetary planner seeking a safe passage for humanity through the environmental crisis ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153204))
- In natura calculation ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153209))
- uses an information system that allows one to see how different goods relate to one another as a whole ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153213))
- Many previously proposed planning schemes rely on labor time as a universal metric to organize production and distribution. Such schemes expend enormous effort in designing a system that corrects for the inevitable distortions created by this strange kind of money or “time chits” because it is difficult to account for the fact that some workers are more effective than others, or some work is more skilled ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153222))
- The goal of socialism is not to replicate the market, but to allow humanity to consciously regulate itself and its interchange with nature. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20153224))
- Supplying the necessary electricity would require a 40-fold increase in wind power and a 170-fold increase in photovoltaics as of 2015. As the energy scholar Vaclav Smil points out, “such a ramping-up of all kinds of capacities — design, permitting, financing, engineering, construction, all going up between one and five orders of magnitude in less than two decades — is far, far beyond anything that has been witnessed in more than a century of developing modern energy systems ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20154077))
- Planners could set several constraints, including an energy quota; various planetary boundaries, such as global temperature or the amount of land set aside for wildlife; and the state of infrastructure and industry (e.g., to what extent are they electrified?) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1515324456/20158235))
- Gosplant would have to decide whether to minimize land use or CO2 emissions, in addition to setting energy and food quotas. The numbers underpinning these variables are based on the current state of technology in various fields — so no cold fusion or fast-breeder reactors. The only futuristic element in our model is population, which we set at 10 billion people — the estimated global population in 2050.
