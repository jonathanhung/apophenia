- the change is the constant yes then also to recog iiz that this change that we are in is so
  rapid and so transcontextual ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he1v2v1198kzg1ng8zy6sw2v))
- it's really important in this moment that we be able to look backward and recognize the mistakes without despising
  our ancestors but to allow for the learning to take place that needs to take place and this is a tricky one because it's not easy it's it's much easier to justify and to say they did the best they could at the time and to give benefit of the doubt and to say you know with respect and awe we give thanks to our ancestors and
  and okay yeah and really exploitative violent mistakes have been made by some people's ancestors more than others let's not let's not be fooled um but but the question is not about making them wrong the question is about holding learning and mutual learning with our ancestors who are already gone how do we
  hold the mutual learning across the generations when those Generations are gone and for me this is a very very beautiful question because there are lots of cultures in which there is the belief that when there is learning that learning spans multiple generations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he1v4042jp3ywa0vns6nmwpz))
- worked with indigenous leaders recently because I have a strong sense that their understanding of reality and their connection to not just to ancestors but to to trees or the trees connection to people all of that
  is actually teaching us something as well that we desperately need in the west that separation that is fundamental to our thinking categories uh labels names all of that is so disconnected really from what it is from the Continuum of experience ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he1v5p6m8bh0j5esjxky94pe))
- but I blame Genesis for part of the trouble we are in in the West because it says in the first few
  paragraph make the world under your Dominion you know it says go exploit it it doesn't use that word but that's basically the Mandate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he1v66c8haep3rt45e5wzf9r))
- there are these ghosts and by that I am referring to habits of ways of thinking and habits of perception that are so um they're old and
  entrenched and they are yeah they're they're old and because we don't know where they started from we can't really untangle them anymore so there's this need to I think really be on the watch out for those moments when these ghosts sneak out and they sneak out in your vocabulary they sneak out in tone of voice they sneak out when I'm
  telling you know when I'm anxious for my kids whether or not they're going to get into University as I'm watching such incredible anthrop anthrop anthropos scenes change that I you know sort of like really you're gonna send your kid out to get a job um so what what and yet of course I have to send my kid out to get a job right of course and at the same time it's such an inadequate response to
  really what's happening and in that exact moment I think we're looking at these ghosts in the way that you have to be of the continuing of the system to stay alive but if the system does not discontinue we're in big trouble ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he1vb7257sx4zqr7e82d73f2))
- I have been around in this
  scene for a long time and um I mean I was the three and four years old at dinner tables 50 years ago with people having conversations about the urgency to address the change in epistemology and the exploitation of Nature and each other and um you know communication and basically all the things we're talking about now we've been talking about for a long time and the trends have come and
  they've gone ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he1w42zvzn3zrsnbx0a7vs1h))
