- Too many companies wait until they think they know the solution to a problem then engage design (again, acting like the job of design is making the solution look pretty instead of deeply engaging with the problem itself). Now the designer is in the uncomfortable position of slowing things down to learn about the problem, push back on assumptions, and ask questions that may have already been asked. This leaves designers feeling under-valued and left out of a process they were told they were going to be a part of. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1510974436/19713631))
    - Note: Endemic. not hiring designers to solve problems or engage with it deeply. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Ideally, the design org should be a peer to engineering, product, and marketing, not subsumed under one of them. When it is subsumed, so is the voice of design. It causes design to lack visibility and input at the strategic level (this is part of why design is so often playing catchup to a project), and designers have to roll up to other functions that don’t understand how to advocate for design or resource design work. It’s a vicious circle. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1510974436/19713635))
