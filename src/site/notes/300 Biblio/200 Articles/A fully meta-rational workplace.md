## Highlights

- You joined because the company is known for repeatedly producing peculiar products that… well, the business press says “wtf is this, no one wants that, they’ve really screwed it up this time,” and a couple years later fanatical customers say they can’t imagine how they lived without it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he8ywdc1xzc9f6asjt6d2sxf))
- You aren’t “assigned to a team,” and in fact someone tells you on the first day that there aren’t any. But during the first week, you spend most of your time talking with people who are interested in your previous work. They’re fun discussions, because they’re also interested in their own work, and love talking about it, which gets you interested too. You begin to notice a pattern, as well: they are particularly interested in *how you think and feel* about types of work. And by the second week, you’re offering your advice, which they take seriously, and you’ve gotten sucked into helping with several different projects that are actually quite cool, and the sort of thing you can do parts of well—and you’re confident you’ll learn how to do more parts through participation in the work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he8ywtdr7tqmrzks5dk6j4nx))
- **There is no overall plan for anything**, because it’s impossible to plan for discontinuous innovation. But individual projects often get detailed, rational plans as they move toward realization. People working on a project construct plans as they go, and ignore or revise them when they aren’t working, and no one makes a fuss about it. Plans, of different sorts, are just tools for efficient work, sometimes useful and sometimes not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he8yxb7f6r033r74g02drsz3))
- **No one knows what the organization is supposed to be trying to do**, but its members constantly discuss possible directions, what purposes are worthwhile, and what might be feasible in practice.
  The organization’s conception of itself has changed several times over the years. What it’s trying to do next year might be different again.
  **It’s completely unclear who is responsible for what**, because the nature of the work is constantly changing, and which projects are most important fluctuates unpredictably. However, everyone can mostly trust—based on experience—that others will dive in to help when needed.
  **People frequently take on tasks they have no qualifications for, just because they feel like it. No one understands the work they are doing, and no one thinks that’s a problem** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he8yy2tw83099abzzdrvjh81))

  “General competence” is a result of meta-rationality. That is the attitude that you are willing and potentially able to do whatever needs to be done ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he8yy9f6vtcg4xjw2cnh94kp))
- General competence doesn’t mean you are expert at everything—no one can be. It’s based on a realistic assessment of what you can do now, and how long it may take you to figure out how to do something *well enough* outside your areas of expertise. The confidence of an expert is based on a self-definition as someone with complete knowledge of a circumscribed rational system. The confidence of the generally competent is based on absence of any self-definition. You do not identify as “a professional software engineer.” The boundaries of your self are [nebulous](https://meaningness.com/nebulosity), so you are not limited to any system. You are meta to all systems, and can juggle them as needed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he8yzh7q1vmfdqj8yq4ssm76))
