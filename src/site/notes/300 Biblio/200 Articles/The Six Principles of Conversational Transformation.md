- Even as our work has become more complex, collaborative, continuous, and interactive, we still tend to recognize those who produce visible artifacts more than other vital members of the team (such as researchers, project mangers, strategists) who contribute to overall success. We still overvalue artifacts and attempt to assign sole authorship.
