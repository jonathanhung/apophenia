- But even amongst young women there are those who are pretty just on the outside, and those whose beauty springs from their depths. As a woman ages, her skin begins to lose its youthful capacity to conduct life force. What remains obvious of her feminine radiance is primarily her beauty of depth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge96wckf8bcvpc5h6q1pbtyc))
- the open-hearted awe and mindless swoon you feel in the company of a woman who moves, breathes, smiles, and shines radiant feminine energy like a goddess. When looking into such a woman's eyes, you feel an almost breathtaking depth of compassion, love, and mystery. This deep feminine beauty or radiance need not be diminished by age. Actually, it can be magnified, deepened, and glorified ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge96x4ebww0n1thskqs4y3x2))
- If you find yourself attracted to younger women, be careful that you aren't trying to find an easy relationship with a woman who will let you slide. If your purpose is to become ever more free of your self-burdens and give your true gift to the world, then a spiritually mature woman-who won't let you slather in your comfy habits of security and distraction may be an excellent ally for your journey. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge9701axf3n2611gx76ez7h1))
- Through these means, his desire is converted into fullness of heart. His lust is converted into service. His desire is not converted by denying sexual attraction, but by enjoying it fully, circulating it through his body (without allowing it to stagnate as mental fantasy), and returning it to the world, from his heart. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge971edxsnzezwrm4wkyza1f))
- If you are like most men, sexual energy tends to go directly to one of two places. Either your head becomes stimulated and you fantasize about being with a woman who turns you on, or your genitals become stimulated in lustful need. Your head and genitals, however, are just the north and south poles of the whole body. A superior man circulates the energy of arousal throughout his body, taking particular care not to let it stagnate in swollen fantasies or appendages. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge97236vd62dt3qgf7ft29jm))
- As a man, you probably have much more to give the world than your children. Just as beautiful women inspire biological procreation, they also inspire artistic, social, and spiritual creativity. When it comes down to it, most creative men will admit that, one way or another, women are their muse and inspiration. Women bring them into the world. Women move them to create and serve humanity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge9735sy1nj61pemjh82p8cn))
- This explosion of gifting could be the basis of your life, not just a moment of sexual yielding. When you feel sexual lust or desire for any woman, breathe deeply and allow the feeling of desire to magnify. And allow it to magnify more. Don't let the energy become lodged in your head or genitals, but circulate it throughout your body. Using your breath as the instrument of circulation, bathe every cell in the stimulated energy. Inhale it into your heart, and then feel outward from your heart, feeling the world as if it were your lover. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge974wq535q8ehzm8qqyr7ks))
- And this is exactly what a mediocre man does: He stays with a woman and a project for as long as they interest him and turn him on. When the excitement seems to wear off, he moves on to another and then another hopeful source of polarity and excitement. It is not time that kills delight, but familiarity, neutralization, and lack of purpose. Another man might find your woman to be quite a turn-on even though she seems old-shoe to you. It may not be your woman who has worn out, but your capacity for desire. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge97935455tjqvtfd1trh7ja))
- He knows that when things get dreary it is his own doing. He knows that he is only truly happy when giving his gift, fully and to the last drop. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge97by5bb6cj399kfsartx5y))
- A man's attraction to women must be converted from attraction to women into attraction through women. He must feel his desire without suppression, and then feel through his desire into the source-energy ofdesire. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge97dzfgay4gyc7kpe7jv9wk))
- In your enjoyment of pleasure and delight, never forget that your sensations and feelings are fleeting, and never absolutely enough. Women can attract you, heal you, and inspire your gifts, but they will never satisfy you absolutely. Never. And you know this. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge97h9tj3ekg58s9115j48zs))
- You are deceived by themirage of your own desire. You are deluded by your own excitement. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge97k5hy985gpajzbvwew47a))
- You are least unhappy when you are relieved of the need to get any-thing at all from appearance. Just driving in your car, wanting nothing, watching the trees go by, can be an epiphany of perfection. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge97n2czrwt4tfbzwjt5mrmn))
- Instead, chase. Allow yourself to feel how badly you want her. Feel how deep is the itch you want scratched. Feel the need that drives you, for most of your adult life, to yearn for a woman, in flesh or in fantasy. And discover what it is you really want. You've had tit. You've had pussy. You've had nurturing. You've had wild passion. And none of it lasted. It wasn't even that good as long as it did last. Your need is far deeper than any woman can provide. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge97ntm2akysfpr905e1bts2))
- She is the goddess, ready to fuck you, murder you, and enlighten you. Her appearance and your desire can be an endless drama of need, or they can merge, becoming a doorway to your divine source. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge97q3fprpgrsp7egz32mpn6))
- In a subtle way, excess ejaculations will diminish your courage to take risks, professionally and spiritually. You will settle for doing enough to get by, to be comfortable, but you will find that you would rather watch TV than write your novel, meditate, or make that important phone call. You will have enough motivation to live a decent life, but ejaculations drain you of the "cutting through" energy that is necessary to pierce your own wall of lethargy and slice through the obstructions that arise in the world. Your gift will remain largely un-given. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge97vegew0p2w5ysk87a6nx8))
- If she can drain you, so can the world. If she waits for your deepest gifts, as you lie feebly in the bed of undesire, so might the world. She senses that you have succumbed to her, that you have allowed temporary pleasures to diminish your capacity for fullest consciousness. She knows you will likewise succumb to the world. One part of your woman is happy she made you come. She is happy you are relaxed and enjoying yourself. Another part of her is disappoint-ed that you've allowed yourself to choose a temporary and pleasurable spasm over the endless ravishment of her and the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge97x0jtrgqs1y76gawfrz6d))
- A superior man is dedicated to the magnification of love through sexuality. He does not settle for less than the total surrender of his woman's heart, as well as his own, into the fullness of divine union. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge982fs9xy3aerwfbee4beqx))
- Just as your woman tests you emotionally, so she will test you sexually. Even when you are trying not to ejaculate, she may energetically begin to "pull" the ejaculation from you. As always, her deepest pleasure is in feeling your fullness, your strength, and your love, even while she is testing you. When you don't ejaculate, but demonstrate that the fullness of loving is more important to you than the quick thrill of genital release, then she can truly trust you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge9839e8n3fbghzr18ptx4kj))
- Your addiction to cycles of release will stop you short of full and conscious dissolution in your deepest source, and so your true gifts will not emerge. By strengthening your capacity for the fullest communion sexually, you also strengthen your capacity to dissolve into the source of life and reemerge soaked in gifts, erect with purpose, and full of desire to give your deepest gifts in the face of worldly resistance to you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge984myrn7t6m3mzyqr5mwvh))
- The main way you generate bodily tension is by turning your attention back on yourself in self-concern, curling into yourself so tightly you feel all knotted up. Therefore, the main cure is to give yourself to others. Whenever you notice that you are mulling over your own problems, knotting energy into your body as tension, take that energy and create a gift for others.

- or elated about your intimacy as your woman is.Don't fake it. Don't try to act concerned for the sake of your woman. She can feel where you are really at. Instead, be authentic to your core desires, and dedicate your life, with utter impeccability, to your highest goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge98f58psgqwqht371ykkfyb))
- The point is not to be her therapist, but to be her wake-up call, her heart-opener, her reminder of the primacy of love. If it takes you more than five minutes to open her into love, you are probably talking too much and acting too little. Or, perhaps you have forgotten your true purpose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge98jmqg2mazyea18cde58pw))
- Your masculine gift is to know where you are, where you want to be, and what you need to do to get there. If you don't know one of these, then you need to discover it by any means necessary. This vision is, essentially, the basic gift you have to offer your woman, as well as the world. If you have no higher vision than the day-to-day grind of housework, job, childcare, TV, and vacations, you are failing your birthright. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge98kayqna6a22295r5ace0r))
- Because you probably tend to become lost in your thoughts, in your goals, and in your projects, one of the main gifts your woman can offer you is getting you into your body, into the present, into love, which connects you to your source. Through her touch, her loving, and her attractiveness, she can also give you energy, so that your whole body becomes like an erection, full and alive, and ready to penetrate the world into love. Your woman might be the President of the United States. Still, if you have a masculine sexual essence, her special gift to you is to bring you back into your body with the attractive force of her feminine energy. Without a woman to serve your present embodiment of love, you might spend most of your time working on your projects, staring into a computer screen, churning thoughts in your head, or seeking future goals of financial or spiritual freedom. Meanwhile, you have lost touch with the present, with your body and your woman. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge98nsqpybjg6cr3mbmty30c))
- With compassion, he slices through all bullshit and demands authenticity and humor. It's as if he were saying to his woman, "The divine way or the highway!" It's the same masculine insistence on direction that a weaker man will demand. But rather than wanting his woman to follow his personal direction, a superior man wants her to move in the direction that most serves her growth in love and happiness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge98q8wwnmh93d52j31ac3d0))
- If you don't know your own direction in life, you certainly will stand on shaky ground offering your woman direction. So the first step is to align your own life so that, at least in this present moment, you are living at your edge, fully aligned with sense of purpose. If you are not absolutely certain that, in this moment, you are living exactly the life you need to, then your woman will feel your lack of clarity, and she will fight any kind of guidance you offer her. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge98qzcmjq5k02basr2d0t0p))
- You are entirely responsible for cutting through your own laziness, addictions, and unclarity. There is nothing to wait for and nobody to blame. Whatever techniques are appropriate, use them. Try talking with your friends, using therapy, practicing meditation or prayer, going on a vision quest, reading scripture, walking in nature, keeping a journal, or studying with a teacher. Remember that your success with any method you choose depends entirely on your actual commitment to discovering your deepest truth and aligning your life with it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge98vg15ydjvksgwqh0m92j4))
- Unadorned suffering is the bedmate of masculine growth. Only by staying intimate with your personal suffering can you feel through it to its source. By putting all your attention into work, TV, sex, and reading, your suffering remains unpenetrated, and the source remains hidden. Your life becomes structured entirely by your favorite means of sidestepping the suffering you rarely allow yourself to feel. And when you do touch the surface of your suffering, perhaps in the form of boredom, you quickly pick up a magazine or the remote control. Instead, feel your suffering, rest with it, embrace it, make love with it. Feel your suffering so deeply and thoroughly that you penetrate it, and realize its fearful foundation. Almost everything you do, you do because you are afraid to die. And yet dying is exactly what you are doing, from the moment you are born ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge98yj732g8nnwp3d89qe4qh))
- By eliminating the safety net of comforts in your life, you have the opportunity to free fall in this moment between birth and death, right through the hole of your fear, into the unthreatenable openness which is the source of your gifts. The superior man lives as this spontaneous sacrifice of love. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge98ze2xte2ehs000p45hg2m))
- The point is, there must be a consequence for freezing in the face of fear. There are obvious consequences for freezing in the face of fear when mountain climbing or playing competitive sports. You must instill consequences throughout the rest of your life, unless you want to cling to the safety net of superficial pleasures. The most potent forms of masculine realignment involve both austerity and challenge. Go to the middle of the woods, by yourself, with only survival necessities. Nothing to read, nothing to do. Fast from food and don't sleep for as long as possible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge990w9s3hsehkperqsrzev0))
- get together with your men friends to serve one another. Cut through the bullshit and talk with each other straight. If you feel your friend is wasting his life, tell him so, because you love him. Welcome such criticism from your friends. Suggest challenges for each other to take on, in order to bring each other through the fears which limit your surrender in gifting. Always agree on consequences for not persisting in the challenge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge99288zn66qdvdb20h1a520))
