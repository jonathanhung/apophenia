- User-centered design has a better track record than high modern design, but it still exerts a homogenizing effect. The needs of the modal user are accommodated and scaled through software or industrial manufacturing, while power users and those with edge cases can do nothing but actively petition the designer for attention. In most cases, diverse users with a wide variety of niche use cases are forced to conform to the behavior of the modal user.

- [Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(cybernetics)) states that enabling control depends on the controlling system (i.e. the tool) having at least as many possible states as the system it controls (i.e. the end-user’s design problem). In Ashby’s words:
  *In order to deal properly with the diversity of problems the world throws at you, you need to have a repertoire of responses which are (at least) as nuanced as the problems you face.*
  In other words, to address the long-tail problem, the tool must be flexible enough that it can be adapted to unexpected and idiosyncratic problem spaces—especially those unanticipated by the tool’s designer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h90sw79pc95qyc4ggrv7c078))
- Design for emergence is composable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h90sx24p5tfdb1kmwvbewhy1))
- Generations of enterprise software designers have had to answer the difficult question: “Why wouldn’t our users just do this in Excel?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h90t0gnrh6e0dyxf13wne9w5))
