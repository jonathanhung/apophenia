- Our relationship with hope shapes how we approach research and design. It helps cultivate a deeper understanding of the clarity we need to be inclusive, ethical, and caring—traits that are at the foundation of humanity-centered design.
  Today, it’s clear that many designers are feeling overwhelmed, disillusioned, and even unsafe within their organizations—and design leaders are recognizing that conversations around burnout and stress aren’t quite cutting it. I’ve found a deep sense of comfort in the words of American activist, grassroots organizer, and abolitionist Mariame Kaba: “Hope doesn’t preclude feeling sadness or frustration or anger or any other emotion that makes total sense. Hope isn’t an emotion…Hope is not optimism. Hope is a discipline… we have to practice it every single day.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw2ffc2g1t31yv40v00e7qb2))

- many in the design community have grown tired and numb to witnessing mainstream design thought leaders debate the same concepts, only to reinforce branded orthodoxies that, at best, lead to the constant repackaging of ideas into books, blogs, and articles and, at worst, a prideful competition for relevance.

- we show up for our participants, our colleagues, and ourselves, which is determined by our relationship to our values and how we allow hope to activate them. Designers’ relationship to hope dictates their ability to believe that things could be better and different for customers, participants, and users—and most importantly, for themselves. Hope influences our ability to engage an ethic of creativity as we imagine how a deeper understanding of people can lead to more positive experiences. Hope is anchored in the belief that others *and* ourselves deserve better, and that better can be possible if we commit to being more human toward ourselves and others.
