- Asking what you get out of porn is a *defense* from the real question, which is actually, “What is porn getting you out of?”
  Answer: Intimacy.
  A common belief is that people turn to porn because they can’t find sex or intimacy in real life.
  Teach turns this logic on its head: people don’t *want* sex or intimacy in real life.
  Thus, porn. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8yc8n0470fqw75wnjydvbkm))
- man’s “motivational system has evolved to deploy his courtship effort where it makes a difference to his reproductive success—mainly by focusing it where it improves his rate of sexual intercourse…Frustratingly, a woman may find that the greater the sexual commitment she displays the less her man speaks.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8ycad4tmewf1qff81yzpdgr))
- But why does the man (according to the book) feel that his wife has deprived him?
  Because he sees her as she is, not as others see her.
  The book makes a distinction between sexualized fantasy versus mundane reality by invoking two archetypes: the econ major and the sorority girl.
  Of course, an econ major can be in a sorority. But the book states “She can only be a fantasy if she stops being an econ major” and instead becomes a sorority girl.
  And if you do fulfill your fantasy by being with a sorority girl, and eventually marry her, the excitement wanes as you discover she is just an econ major. Even if she really is/was a sorority girl.
  Others see her as a sorority girl, they see an idealized image of her. They don’t see the mundane reality that you see, of her as an econ major. Thus, you feel deprived that only others get access to this idealized fantasy version of her. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8ycd96m47x68g4fym8fa0aj))
