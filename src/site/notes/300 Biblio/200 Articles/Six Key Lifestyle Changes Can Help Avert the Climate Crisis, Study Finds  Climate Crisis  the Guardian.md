- The Jump campaign asks people to sign up to take the following six “shifts” for one, three or six months:
  Eat a largely plant-based diet, with healthy portions and no waste
  Buy no more than three new items of clothing per year
  Keep electrical products for at least seven years
  Take no more than one short haul flight every three years and one long haul flight every eight years
  Get rid of personal motor vehicles if you can – and if not keep hold of your existing vehicle for longer
  Make at least one life shift to nudge the system, like moving to a green energy, insulating your home or changing pension supplier
