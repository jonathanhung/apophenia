## Highlights

- the Europa people are  
  a very very earthy grounded people their  cosmologies are interwoven with stories of   tricksters and lands and undulating places ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he74gt10cw0q3bqdrvqdq261))
- my protest against the flattening of  colonialism and imperialism and to seek   out different ways of addressing this crisis  because colonization isn't just infrastructural   it's not experiential yes it shapes how we think  and how we tell stories and how we meet people and   how we dream the film yeah yeah but colonization  has been Justified with the idea of development  
  because the colonial power always uh I said that  we came here to help to help you and to bring   you uh development and uh of course this the work  development came in the middle of the 20th century   but before that they were just bringing culture  or or something else and they were always there  
  for good although it brought with it so many bad  things but that was not the original intention   well um colonization is the Interruption  of a different rationality you could think   it's a logic imposing itself on a different  logic it's it's interruptive it's disruptive  
  um it comes with a world and a worlding of its  own it's a ritual it's a place making project ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he74p8t8hzk39dpq0fptrp53))
- procrastis yes the of course the procrastin bed  is a technology yes um and of course the for those  
  who may not be privy to this story the robber  will take people into his house and would force   them on his bed or give them a bed really there's  no compulsion there but once you're on the bed   he would ensure that you fit the bed so if you're  taller than the bed he would cut your limbs and   if you're shorter than the bed he'll stretch your  limbs to fit the measurement of the bed I think of   I think of this this Imperial rationality as a  prochristian machine yeah what it wants to do is  
  to enforce um a rigid identity is to stabilize  the world to flatten it to recreate it so that   the individual thrives that rationality is  creative it has allowed us to go to the Moon   it has allowed us to build cars and vehicles of  great sophistication but it has lost other kinds  
  of sophistication ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he74emr79qq1r2ydzaa5xw37))
- Yoruba people describe issue   are shapeshifter yes um shapeshifter and most  importantly very critically the holder of Asher   now Asher is the fluid emergence of everything   how things come to be how things work  like we're having this glass of lemonade  
  um that I'm able to taste this lemonade is  Asher right oh you see that we are we are   wearing shirts and we're feeling some warmth  right now is Asher when things stop working   that's the loss of Aging you can think of it as  agency like the agency of everything is Asher now ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he74fdd175ctanm1bw66919j))
    - Note: The agency of everything is Asher [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- well you know the trickster always fails in  something and he's very wise but I mean and very  
  smart but also very clumsy and dumb at the same  time that's uh this uh duplicity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he7v2btsrt6yjfnarkwdy948))
