## Highlights 
---
- embed a change management approach in our Agile development processes to support those transitions. This targeted effort is designed to help CMS users create better content while reducing demand on the help desk. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ezdzp2whbxw1zc27x701ha))
- It’s the cumulative impact of change on our users that we as designers need to better understand when we introduce product changes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ezg29m6hykvnfgxwacxc8v))
- Before we could think about our change management approach in the VA Drupal project, we needed a deeper understanding of the impacts of our product changes on CMS editors:
  • How would a product change impact the day-to-day work by an editor?
  • How do they set their priorities?
  • How different or difficult is a Drupal feature to learn and use?
  **The line of questioning that product teams typically use to research their users’ experience can be broadened to better understand change impacts.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ezhm2f194vkdzx3s2cgftz))
- CivicActions created a template for listing the editor type by section, and then assigned a score of 1 to 5 (5 being high) on the degree of change across 5 dimensions:
  • Type of change
  • Degree of process change
  • Degree of technology change
  • Degree of job role change
  • Timeframe for the change ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ezj3rjv65391j8yp4cswjm))
- To make this transition as pain-free as possible, our team not only tested the new CMS design with editors, we also tested the communications to be sent to all editors before the launch, the day of the launch and post-launch with a small group of editors for clarity and understanding.
  This communications strategy was more complex, given the beta testing cycle before launch. To account for all the moving parts, we used a [service design map](https://app.mural.co/t/civicactions3117/m/civicactions3117/1666879283456/80bcc861a796b7efe1539d3f623017da687fb002?sender=u31df4f199540466f5c2a0712) to see how our product rollout needed to be supported by change management, and vice versa. Validating this map with our Product Owner, key stakeholders, user support and engineers helped not only to identify gaps and opportunities for a smoother transition, but also to clarify roles and responsibilities. We updated the map frequently to adjust timelines and identify any new roadblocks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ezsqy0t4m6wyqej3z8p3y2))
