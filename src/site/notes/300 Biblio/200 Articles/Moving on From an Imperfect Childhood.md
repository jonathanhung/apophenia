- Holes show up when we are stuck: stuck in a bad relationship, in anger, sadness, anxiety, or feeling like a victim. The first step to repair these parent holes is to embrace radical empathy for yourself. In this process, you walk through your emotions with a therapist, a friend, or a spiritual teacher. Rather than blaming yourself for your choices, feelings, and mistakes, you recognize and empathize with your lost self, the self that might be whole today had you been parented differently.

- Armed with your new understanding, you may want to seek some type of rapprochement. Many grateful grievers choose to return to the original scene of the crime—their childhoods. They want to ask their parents to recognize and honor the pain they suffered during their childhood; they long for their parents to own their mistakes. If parents have evolved emotionally since raising their children, this can be quite healing. I have heard many examples of mothers and fathers who apologize to their grown-up kids, saying things like: “If I had known better, I would have done better.” Or, “If I could go back and change things, I would.” One father told his daughter, “Can you ever forgive me for calling you fat? It was so hurtful and wrong, and I am deeply sorry, you have always been my beautiful girl.”
  “Adulthood actually happens when we can accept that we don’t need our parents to validate ourselves.”
  Pure apologies, not paired with excuses, can be wonderfully healing. But grateful grievers risk the opposite reaction, re-injuring the original wound. I have had multiple clients whose mothers and fathers (some in the hospital on their death beds) could not give their children the love/repair they so desperately yearned for and needed.

- When children have been verbally or physically abused, often repair isn’t possible if the pattern does not change, and the best path in some cases may be to limit contact with the abuser, or cut it off entirely. But even in less volatile relationships, when we depend on our parents to fill the holes, we set ourselves up to fail. We stay a dependent child: stuck, waiting, resentful, victimized, and chronically reactivating our childhood wounds. As my friend did so well, we must figure out how to parent ourselves in a positive way. Then we can begin the hard work of self-discovery, constructing a separate self, and replacing the old critical internal monologue with a new and loving message.

- The process of grateful grieving is a rebirth. We start out mourning the childhood we never had, feeling sad and angry for our losses. Slowly we move to grateful grieving—a way station. Evolved adults can hold two or more feelings in their heart simultaneously. They accept that their parents are not all good or all bad, but flawed people doing the best they can, even if it is not good enough. Once we make peace with ambivalence and learn to parent ourselves, we are free to move through the way station of grateful grief and enter the space of pure gratitude, where we are grateful for our parents’ good qualities, and we understand and accept their limitations—which can serve as catalysts for our own transformation. The weight of anger, victimization, fear, and even hate, begins to lift. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyhrnmkb1ertvgs0qb94jm2))
- What if we expand the notion of traditional parenthood by embracing a metaphorical market—a kaleidoscope of parental figures we create ourselves? What if we grow our definition of parenting, so that it is not limited to the traditional dyad. We begin by collecting a collage of mentors who teach and inspire us; then build our parental figures from these people, selecting those with qualities we admire and need. We can choose among great friends, therapists, teachers, and partners, those who help us grow and heal. We can even reach beyond our immediate circles: We may be comforted by the mothering of Mother Teresa or the fathering of the Dalai Lama—why not include them in our design?
  “What if we grow our definition of parenting, so that it is not limited to the traditional dyad.”
  Then comes the fun. We build this kaleidoscope of parenting by inserting the pieces we’re missing in our psyches, filling the spaces that still hurt in our hearts, and adding color and light to our lives to heal our deepest wounds. How comforting to exhale into a more expansive and loving parent: Look around you—your kaleidoscope awaits. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyhsksd497793ms5hdk4h0p))
