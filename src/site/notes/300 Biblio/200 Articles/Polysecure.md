- I’M WRITING THIS BOOK because I believe in love. Again and again, I have experienced the power of love to heal, to bridge, to connect and to awaken, as well as the trauma that ensues in its absence. In many ways my life is centered in not just believing in love, but in being love. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfk4hdmdyq8gtv87k67rb4x9))

- One day Corey admitted to having an anxious attachment style. We both wanted our relationship to be a close and connected one, but we also knew that living together and blending our families was not in the cards for us, so we began to wonder how we could establish more secure functioning together without the boost in security that comes from either living with a partner, being primaries, sharing �nances or having a child together.

- Part One covers an overview of attachment theory and trauma. In
  Chapter One, I offer a general description of attachment theory and how different childhood experiences relate to the four different attachment styles that people can develop. Chapter Two explores some aspects of attachment that are less commonly discussed in the mainstream attachment literature. Here we take a look at the different dimensions of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance as a more precise way to understand the four different attachment styles. I also reframe the attachment styles based on their strengths and desires (not just their dysfunctions), highlighting how insecure attachment styles can also be expressions of the healthy drives for autonomy and connection. I also discuss the importance of the relationship between attachment styles, boundaries and the giving and receiving of love. In Chapter ree, I present the nested model of attachment and trauma, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfk4zze8r9cff8v7b739z5as))

- A de�ning factor of the preoccupied style is how the person’s hyperactivated attachment strategy not only ampli�es their attachment bids, but also intensi�es their focus on their partners. Because of this, they may end up constantly monitoring their partners’ level of availability, interest and responsiveness. e partner of someone with a preoccupied attachment style may then feel like this constant tracking of relational misattunements and mistakes is controlling of them. But for the person with a preoccupied attachment style, this behavior is less an attempt to overtly control their partner than it is a symptom of their attachment system being overly sensitive to even the slightest sign they might be le ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfk5d6r29kgq5p9deajm2q3z))
- In such cases, the caregiving is more of a strategy to keep a person close than an actual response to what their partner genuinely needs. If someone with this attachment style perceives even the slightest possibility that their partner is disconnected or disinterested, they can become demanding, possessive or needy for approval, reassurance, connection, contact, and greater emotional or sexual intensity.

- Attachment unfolds over multiple levels of the human experience. When
  referring to diﬀerent levels of experience, I am pointing to the diﬀerent
  dimensions or aspects of our human experience: self, relationships, home,
  local communities and culture, societal, and the global or collective. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdpsqh7xt7nz8zbw833xvnn))
- To oﬀer a simple example, if I am looking to buy a new car, there are
  several diﬀerent facets or levels of my life that can in uence my decision. At
  the self level, I might think about which car most appeals to me based on my
  individual preferences, likes, dislikes, needs and what I can aﬀord. If I
  expand beyond my personal perspective to the relational level, I will
  consider which car would be best for my family, including my son’s needs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdpta914y0qk717592dtazp))
- Relationship Level
  is level refers to your one-on-one interpersonal experiences with your
  parents, family members, close friends, lovers and partners. It holds the
  quality of interactions that you have had with your attachment gures, how
  you have been treated and how you have treated others. When we talk about
  our attachment needs being met or not met by our attachment gures we are
  referring to this level, and it is what happens at this level that then ows
  down and transfers to the self level, aﬀecting whether we take on more
  secure or insecure attachment adaptations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdpx5wymdj2tv8mwkpdsnbn))
- Research and literature on attachment have provided undeniable
  evidence about how relationships with our parents and lovers shape our
  attachment style, but the impact of siblings is not as commonly discussed,
  despite being just as important to our attachment style. In therapy, I’ve seen
  many clients who identify their interactions with siblings as the source of
  their attachment wounds. Sometimes this stems from parents who neglect to
  protect siblings from each other— ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdpxxj8r70mwkepmjzzgty1))
- Attachment ruptures with siblings can occur when
  there has been overt emotional or verbal abuse, bullying, physical abuse or
  outright rejection. Disconnection resulting from a large age or personality
  diﬀerence, competitiveness and consistent mis-attuned teasing also show up
  in the therapy room as attachment disruptions from sibling relationships. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdpyaxp55mv7h42qt9vzp8s))
- But our relationships with siblings or close friends
  can function as some of the most important attachment bonds that we have.
  For many, a friend or sibling can serve as a primary attachment gure, and
  when there has been attachment wounding with partners or parents, it is
  these very connections that can provide the corrective attachment
  experiences and healing from the attachment disruptions we’ve had with
  others at the relational level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdpyttts1stfftn02t9qh8m))

- is level also includes the physical environment, such as whether or not
  you liked your childhood physical home and bedroom (if you had one) and
  felt safe there. If the home was too messy or too clean, too quiet or too noisy,
  or otherwise not well-matched with you, it could potentially create stress
  and tension in the nervous system, prodding us into survival stress
  responses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdv4r5bh9cn2xyzk5pgpys4))

- ese societal experiences can then trickle all the way down to the
  self level, where social-level issues become internalized as forms of shame or
  self-loathing, again hindering one’s ability to bond, attach and connect.
  Studies have shown that children with socioeconomic risks are more likely
  to develop disorganized attachment34 and that children are at an increased
  risk of disorganized attachment when they are in non-maternal care for
  more than 60 hours a week, due to parental work hours.3 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdq1xhyg8tw2a3eqacexcvc))
- Is it honestly possible to feel safe and secure in a capitalist society that
  de nes our human value based on what we do and how much we make,
  rather than who we are? Is it honestly possible to feel safe and secure in a
  society that bombards us with messages asserting (even aggressing) that in
  order to be secure in our self or with our place in the world we need to
  acquire more money, more religion, more objects, more products, more
  body-altering procedures or more property? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdq2d5stxs2zbqs3dafcab0))

- Climate Trauma is an ever-present existential threat with a bevy of
  constant cognitive reminders—melting ice caps; eroding shorelines;
  waves of homeless refugees; the ravaging storms, ﬂoods, and ﬁres
  broadcast into our homes 24/7; and the constant roll-call of
  disappearing species, vanishing rain forests, and dying coral reefs.
  ere are certain things in life that we cannot “unsee,” and Climate
  Trauma indelibly stamps our consciousness in that way, fundamentally
  altering the way we see the world and our place in it.38
  Not everyone is currently or directly in harm’s way of natural disasters, but
  many of us still experience climate trauma or a preoccupied attachment to
  the earth by living in daily anxiety about the state of our water, air pollution,
  the state of forests, the loss of biodiversity and the extinction of animal
  species, just to name a few. F ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdq7e4ccwctd2bey7k9jsst))

- CONSENSUAL NONMONOGAMY ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdqa6dskmba8613a6f36aw1))
- We have increased choice
  to pick what path in life we want to take, choice in how we identify ourselves
  and the choice of who and how we love. While transformations in
  constructs of race, class, gender and sexual orientation have thus far been in
  the vanguard of this societal change, monogamy has mostly stayed
  unchallenged as a social construct, with those who do not t within its
  constraints nding themselves alienated from a profound social revolution.
  As Esther Perel points out,40 even the monolith of the family has evolved
  with the proliferation of alternatives to the nuclear family ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdqayd5jez6yg00e66k8w6c))
- there is plenty of evidence that the monogamous model
  doesn’t necessarily work, with many people endorsing a proclaimed

  undeniable. C ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdqk6dwg0e9r1v8sew1dvfp))

- People practicing CNM value transparency, consent,
  open and honest communication, personal responsibility, autonomy,
  compassion, sex positivity and freedom for themselves and others.
  Moreover, people practicing CNM typically embrace the following ideas and
  principles: love is not possessive or a nite resource; it is normal to be
  attracted to more than one person at the same time; there are multiple ways
  to practice love, sexual and intimate relationships; and jealousy is not
  something to be avoided or feared, but something that can be informative
  and worked through. Mystic Life, author of Spiritual Polyamory, states, “is
  path requires owning jealousy as it arises, accepting others as they are,
  developing [one’s] own sense of personal wholeness, and letting go of the
  belief that loving someone more means loving someone else less.”43 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdqnm1xsbh72m6wmb67tvrx))
- Why Nonmonogamy? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdqsphepd80z56anj9cmwns))
- When the
  waters of CNM begin to pick up and the emotional rapids of opening up your
  relationship begin, having your why to remember and return to can serve as
  the needed life jacket that keeps you and your relationship a oat. However,
  although two or more people want to practice CNM together—even two
  people in the same marriage—they may not have the same reasons for being
  nonmonogamous. Knowing why you want to practice nonmonogamy and
  how that might be similar to or diﬀerent from your partners’ reasons can
  better inform exactly what your version of nonmonogamy looks like
  together, including the agreements you make with diﬀerent partners, and
  how you go about enacting CNM for yourself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdqtctn0gvrjba2y7p4wjan))

  need ful llment, variety of nonsexual activities and personal growth. Instead
  of expecting one partner to meet all of their needs, people engaged in CNM
  felt that a major advantage of being nonmonogamous was the ability to have
  their diﬀerent needs met by more than one person, as well as being able to
  experience a variety of nonsexual activities that one relationship may not ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdqyr3k0pdqceccg0jyv9qc))
- people reported feeling that being
  nonmonogamous aﬀorded them increased freedom from restriction, self

  people in CNM relationships ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdr020xnz29xr3h0bhqftpy))

  need ful llment, want greater expression of themselves through the
  experiences and activities that will come from having multiple partners and
  say that they are interested in the personal growth and development that
  nonmonogamy inevitably catalyzes. Many people want to give and receive
  the additional love and support that come with having multiple partners. In
  addition to these reasons, I also see people consistently oﬀer three other
  reasons for being nonmonogamous: sexual diversity, philosophical views
  and because CNM is a more authentic expression of who they are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdr31zcgp53ab893xxbd6mh))
- When I ask my own clients why they are either considering CNM or
  already practicing nonmonogamy, most, if not all of them, respond in a way
  that agrees with these ndings. ey declare that they seek to have greater
  need ful llment, want greater expression of themselves through the
  experiences and activities that will come from having multiple partners and
  say that they are interested in the personal growth and development that
  nonmonogamy inevitably catalyzes. Many people want to give and receive

- for many people, nonmonogamy is at least
  partly about the sex. And there’s nothing wrong with that! I think that it’s
  both well-intended and understandable that people say it isn’t about sex,
  since research has shown that people tend to be signi cantly more
  uncomfortable with the idea of CNM relationships that emphasize sex over
  love than they are with CNM relationships that are based more on romantic
  and emotional connections. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdr62pqg3afw3h8abwat99f))
- To me, this is an

- genuinely need and want sexual diversity and it is not because they are
  sexually deviant, avoidantly attached, addicted to sex or noncommittal.
  Instead, they are people who embrace their sexuality and the diverse desires
  and expressions that it may encompass and require. ere are also many
  couples who love each other deeply and have a wonderful partnership, but
  may have very diﬀerent sexual needs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdrba3v1h9bnrzv1tqxy6z3))
- For people whose reason for engaging in nonmonogamy is
  philosophical, oen this outlook arises from their readings or inquiries into
  the history of monogamy and its connection with patriarchal control over
  women’s sexuality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdrbz8pabgj2vzd12x40p79))
- e nal motivation I see in my nonmonogamous clients is that people
  practice CNM because it just feels like this is who they are. For these people,
  nonmonogamy is not so much a lifestyle choice, as it is for some people, but
  rather an expression of their fundamental self. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdrey6wvysfdfbq8yhe4qpa))
- ere is no one right way
  to practice CNM and it is more of a “create your own relationship” than a
  one-size- ts-all approach, but there are still certain distinctions in the ways
  that people practice CNM that are important to name. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdrfw02gahca5ryr13f71e6))
- Open Marriage/Relationship: A relationship where one or both partners in
  a relationship have sexual or romantic relationships outside of their primary
  partnership. Open relationships tend to be more focused on having sex and
  limiting the degree of emotional involvement with others in order to keep
  the primary, dyadic relationship as the rst priority ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdrkbrwaz549hg55wcadwf3))
- Hierarchical Polyamory: A subset of polyamory where there is a ranking
  system among romantic/sexual relationships and some relationships are
  considered more important than others. A person’s primary partner(s)
  would be at the top of this ranking system since primaries usually
  cohabitate, share resources, make decisions together and organize their
  schedules so that they are spending the most amount of time together. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdrjpydzey290d8n7r60vws))
- ATTACHMENT RESEARCH AND RESOURCES for consensually nonmonogamous
  relationships are scarce. It is safe to say that the eld of attachment theory is
  highly mononormative. e overwhelming majority of research conducted
  to understand adult romantic attachment is undertaken with monogamous
  couples, and advice about how to establish a secure attachment either
  assumes monogamy or outright prescribes monogamy as a necessary
  precondition for establishing safety and security. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdrsz37gghwh9h2j0fw682z))
- THE IMPORTANCE OF ATTACHMENT IN CONSENSUAL NONMONOGAMY
  TO START, LET ME SAY that secure attachment with multiple romantic partners is possible. Honestly, it’s really a necessity to do CNM well and thrive, but we’ll get to that. Just as children do not only bond with one attachment �gure, adults do and can have multiple securely attached relationships. When secure functioning is at play within CNM relationships, partners communicate well, trust each other, stick to their agreements and discuss wanted changes. ey tend to have more compersion for their partners, they act respectfully towards their metamours and while they still do experience jealousy or envy, they are also able to support each other in the process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggv9yhn059pkqjy1zkr926h1))
- Going from monogamy to CNM means that people are taking on a
  massive shi in their world view. Almost every aspect of love, romance, sex, partnership and family now has a different set of expectations, practices, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggva9hxxkhrga95qq0jw7fwr))
- Furthermore, when couples transition to CNM from a monogamous
  relationship together, there is the added layer of also deconstructing and reconstructing not just yourself, but your relationship as well. When you’ve shared years or even decades with someone in a monogamous identity together, this can be a particularly arduous transformation process and not every couple survives it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggvaac0p3gqc4ebqnjpb5r0t))
- Much of the mono-romantic ideal encourages forms of codependency, which can remain invisible and even functional for a couple until they open up. It is commonly believed and culturally reinforced that your partner completes you, that your identity should be fused with your partner or the relationship and that your partner is the main source of meaning, love and happiness in your life. True intimacy does not come from enmeshment, but from two differentiated individuals sharing themselves with each other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggvadymd5z3chs11gyywg6rq))
- e paradigm shi creates an awakening of the self, where what was previously unexpressed and unrealized is now awakening in someone, potentially turning their entire world and relationships upside down. People may not just be waking up to their nonmonogamous desires or orientation, but also aspects of their sexuality, important identities or forms of oppressions that have previously been denied, exiled or completely unacknowledged. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggvafchjachmgbxze63984y5))
- I’ve observed that the attachment changes in a person’s relationship(s)
  that occur from becoming nonmonogamous are at the foundation of struggles with being CNM (as well as any previous insecure attachment traumas that can get brought into their relationships). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggvagy0g4zqfgx4qe92c28wd))
- Going CNM can expose your individual attachment insecurity.
  For some people, monogamy can serve as a stand-in for actual secure attachment. Since the rules and structure of monogamy are so well-known and so strongly reinforced, many times all you have to do is fall back on the structure of monogamy itself to create a sense of safety in a relationship. e very fact of being monogamously exclusive, verbally committed or legally married can be sufficient enough for some people to feel secure in the relationship. When these people then remove the structure of monogamy by going nonmonogamous, their own insecure attachment style can get exposed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggvajeephzsyrky3q63rgvff))
- Monogamy can also buffer us from our own personal insecurities. ese
  may or may not be attachment-based, but can be rooted in relational and cultural traumas or anxieties about our achievements, looks, intellectual abilities, likability, etc. When we commit to a long-term monogamous partnership or get married, these insecurities may still show up every now and again, but many of them get eclipsed by the very fact that we have someone who has devoted themselves to us, someone who we think will love us and stay with us no matter how pimply our butt gets, no matter how much our body changes or no matter how stained and worn-out our underwear becomes.

In such cases, our self-esteem and sense of self-worth are contingent on our partner being monogamously committed to us instead of anchored in our own internal sense of self-worth, self-love and selfesteem. When people have depended on their partner’s exclusivity for their own self-con�dence, going nonmonogamous can pop the cork on all of their personal insecurities, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggvame7sxjx3ktd5s59cfrj4))
- Examples of signs that your transition to CNM has exposed your own
  attachment insecurity: You intellectually want to be nonmonogamous, but you’re having trouble with emotionally getting on board. Even though your partner has been wonderful about meeting enough of your relationship needs and is doing a good job reassuring you that you matter to them, you still experience a roller-coaster of anxiety before and/or during the time they spend with other people, or you start to withdraw to protect yourself. You intellectually want to feel compersion for your partner having positive experiences with others, but you keep interpreting them being with others as a sign of your de�ciency. Aer opening up, you are �ooded with many of your childhood experiences and/or past traumas. Aer opening up, you realized that you have patterns of emotional/relational avoidance or codependency.

- Deconstructing monogamy, whether you identify as nonmonogamous by
  orientation or as a lifestyle choice, is not an easy undoing process for

- It is commonly and
  playfully known in the nonmonogamous world that you shouldn’t enter CNM
  unless you are ready to process, communicate, grow and then process,
  communicate and grow some more. is is because having multiple partners
  will expose all of your relationship baggage, your blind spots, shadows and
  shortcomings, and all the potential ways you’ve been asleep to social issues.

  involved. But when we are in attachment-based relationships more is
  required, so the rest of this book will center on people who are (or want to
  be) in polyamorous attachment-based partnerships. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj6s1t0bky3dt3sq9h1dv3g1))
- e antecedent to being polysecure with your partners is rst getting clear
  about whether you want to be attachment gures for each other. Our
  attachment-based relationships take time and investment, and so when
  referring to attachment-based partners I am referring to a choice that we are
  making to intentionally cultivate and tend to the attachment-based needs
  within a particular relationship. Oen, falling in love with someone or
  feeling attached to them does not feel like a choice we make, hence why we
  call it falling in love instead of stepping into love. Our attachment gures
  might be the people we feel levels of connection, compatibility or intensity
  with right from the start for reasons that we just can’t explain, or they may
  be the people with whom our romantic attachments have organically grown
  in potency and depth over time. However you come to be with the partners
  that you already feel attached to or want to cultivate being more polysecure
  with, what is important is that at some point you are all clear that being
  attachment-based partners is what you want for the relationship. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj6s34js10g0jr0h057axf9m))
- Since we are talking about
  attachment-based polyamorous relationships, we are talking about
  relationships in which you are committed to showing up for each other
  regularly, prioritizing each other (from choice, not obligation), actively
  cherishing each other, doing the work required to build a relationship and
  possibly even building a life together (though having a life commitment is
  not a prerequisite for secure attachment). Your attachment-based
  relationships might be with the partners that you refer to as your primary
  partners, inner circle partners, nesting partners or anchor partners. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj6s7myc6wd370aj9sz8k947))
- For us to feel safe and secure in our relationships, we need to know that
  our partners want to be there for us and will be to the best of their ability,
  and so some level of commitment to being in a relationship together is
  important. Depending on what stage of relationship you are in, this might
  look like:
  A commitment to staying in exploration of the relationship together,
  without speci cally de ning the future or integrating your lives.
  A commitment to building an oﬃcial relationship that you want to
  have longevity and/or be more interwoven in.
  Commitment to building a life together where you are in it for the long
  haul. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkpvmr6evcbk5wdsddb2gks))

- Kim Keane oﬀered the following ways that
  people practicing nonmonogamy can demonstrate commitment to their
  partners:
  Sharing intimate details (hopes, dreams, fears) and being vulnerable
  with each other.
  Introducing partners to people who are important to you.
  Helping your partners with moving, packing, homework, job hunting,
  shopping, etc.
  Having regular time together, both mundane and novel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkpww9cw97st35mawsrghh2))
- Making the person a priority. (I suggest de ning what “being a
  priority” means to each of you.)
  Planning trips together.
  Being available to partners when they are sick or in need.
  Collaborating on projects together.
  Having frequent communication.
  Oﬀering physical, logistical or emotional support (e.g. at doctor’s
  appointments or hospital visits or by helping with your partners’ family,
  pets, car, children, taxes, etc.). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkpx0er256b5qbvfb0jzwys))
- Commitment Reﬂection Questions
  In each of your relationships that are already attachment-based, or for the
  relationships that you would like to become more attachment-based, discuss
  the following questions with your partners:
  What does commitment mean to you?
  What aspects of commitment are most important to you (e.g.,
  structural, emotional or public)?
  Why do we want to be attachment gures for each other?
  What does being an attachment gure look like to you?
  Do we each have the time and availability to oﬀer this level of
  involvement? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkq0cnd04vmnh8p62n0tym2))
- John Bowlby and his contemporaries believed that for a partner to become
  an attachment gure, the relationship would serve as both a safe haven and a
  secure base.68 e bedrock of being polysecure in our relationships is feeling
  that we have a safe haven to turn to. is happens when our partners care
  about our safety, seek to respond to our distress, help us to co-regulate and
  soothe and are a source of emotional and physical support and comfort ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkr2s35sm47bzm4hrt1pa4a))
- In search of relationship safety, our attachment system is primed to seek
  the answers to certain questions regarding our partners. Both consciously
  and unconsciously we are looking to know:
  If I turn towards you, will you be there for me?
  Will you receive and accept me instead of attack, criticize, dismiss or
  judge me?
  Will you comfort me?
  Will you respond in a way that calms my nervous system?
  Do I matter to you?
  Do I make a diﬀerence in your life?
  Can we lean into and rely on each other? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkr3y4cxf6ze1d7nagyn39k))
- Examples of things that you and your partners can do to be safe havens
  for each other are:
  Give emotional support and comfort.
  Listen to each other with full attention.
  Inquire and share about feelings and needs.
  Track what is going on in each other’s lives and make sure to follow up
  and inquire about those things.
  Help in practical ways when a partner is tired or sick.
  Discuss or debrief events of the day or things that are important to each
  of you.
  Let your partners know how and why they matter to you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkr6h2646spyjgvq6qe6eb5))
- Safe Haven Reﬂection Questions
  In each of your relationships that are attachment-based or for the
  relationships that you would like to become more attachment-based, ask
  yourself:
  How does this partner already act as a safe haven for me?
  In what ways do they show up for me that feel supportive and
  comforting?
  How can this partner help me feel even more safe with them?
  How can this partner help me feel even more supported or comforted
  by them, in general or in speci c situations?
  In what ways can I show up more as a safe haven for this partner? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkrnmh5mvspst7hrpay0089))
- When safety is established with our attachment gures and we have an
  internalized felt sense that we can turn towards them and lean on them
  when needed, we are freed up to securely turn away from them and engage
  in the world, whether with them by our side or on our own. A secure base
  provides the platform from which we can move out in the larger world,
  explore and take risks. is exploration facilitates our sense of personal
  competence and healthy autonomy. Similar to how children want to show
  their parents their latest drawings, tricks, accomplishments or discoveries, as
  adults we need to share the new things we’ve learned, the things we’ve
  achieved and the things we’re excited about. Being and having a secure base
  in our partnerships means supporting each other’s personal growth and
  exploration, independent activities and other relationships, even when these
  actions require time apart from each other. Secure base partners will not
  only support our explorations, but will also oﬀer guidance when solicited
  and lovingly call us on our shit. ey function as a compassionate mirror for
  our blind spots and all the ways we may be fooling ourselves, whether
  through self-aggrandizement or self-limitation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkrbccshfp84bpexj7whpsy))
- do not underestimate how intimately personal and
  deeply vulnerable it can be for a person to share their visions, hopes,
  curiosities and dreams. It also requires faith to be able to turn away from a
  partner and then trust that you can safely turn back. In simple terms, I see
  being a safe haven as serving the role of accepting and being with me as I
  am, and a secure base as supporting me to grow beyond who I am. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkrmfrrmgkk6kfytdxp99kd))
- Examples of things that you and your partners can do to be secure bases
  for each other:
  Encourage each other’s personal growth and development.
  Support each other’s work and/or interests.
  Listen to each other’s hopes, dreams and visions.
  Listen when your partners share about their experiences in other
  relationships (assuming that the information shared is appropriate and ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkrscwrmknd3mee87k4ydd2))
- consensual).
  Have conversations about things that are intellectually or emotionally
  stimulating to each other.
  Acknowledge each other’s capabilities and possibilities for growth.
  Compassionately bring light to your partner’s limitations and blind
  spots.
  Oﬀer words of encouragement when your partners take on new
  responsibilities, go on dates with others, take a risk or learn something
  new. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkrsjcnenexgcvswrk0zr62))
- In each of your relationships that are attachment-based, or for the
  relationships that you would like to become more attachment-based, ask
  yourself:
  How is this partner already acting as a secure base for me?
  What does growth look like for me? Is it usually a shared or a personal
  experience, or both?
  Are there other ways that I want encouragement or support in my
  individual growth or with my visions and dreams?
  How could my partners support me in regard to my other
  relationships?
  How could I better support or encourage my partners’ dreams or
  aspirations to grow and develop?
  How could I better show genuine interest or curiosity in things that are
  important to my partners?
  How could I better support my partners in their other relationships? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkrxp14de739qz8m4z9407v))
- you don’t have to provide or expect to
  receive all of this from one partner. Diﬀerent partners can be more of a safe
  haven, a secure base or both, oﬀering diﬀerent facets of each. We all have
  diﬀerent strengths and it can be wonderfully satisfying to have some
  partners that support you in safe haven ways, while others oﬀer more of a
  secure base. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkry2e44pkwmajpd54g0cfd))
- In this incident, he was the secure base that I
  needed to be able to con dently turn away from my family and go take a
  risk in the larger world. However, since he was caretaking our son, he was
  understandably not available for any of the safe haven types of emotional
  support that I also needed. is is where my other partner, Sam, stepped in.
  Sam wasn’t able to be at the conference with me, but they made themself
  available to talk on the phone right when my talk was done. ey were
  excited to hear about my experience and gave me their full attention as I
  debriefed everything I needed to. In that instance, Sam was my safe haven. I
  could let my guard down with them, lean into them, and experience being
  accepted with love, warmth and attunement. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjks805qppyx3hf0m42g69n6))
- e result is the acronym HEARTS, which I use to encapsulate the
  diﬀerent ingredients, skills, capacities and ways of being required for secure
  functioning in multiple attachment-based partnerships.

- Optimal functioning of the attachment system and the formation of
  attachment security are best facilitated by consistent interactions with
  signi cant others who are responsive to our needs for proximity. We need to
  know that our attachment gures are available to us, that they are within
  arm’s reach (literally and virtually) and that they will be available and
  responsive when we call for them. W ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjksj4pn3wbb8g4rhs23fqk1))
- Attachment is an embodied experience, and it is rst through being
  present with ourselves in our own bodies and present with our loved ones
  that the rest of the attachment-based skills and capacities of the HEART of
  being polysecure can be developed and expressed. As an adult who wants to
  function from a secure place in your relationships, you can’t aﬃrm, attune,
  repair or even play if you are not here with yourself or with your partners.
  Being present is not just putting your phone down for a few minutes. It is a
  way of being, from interaction to interaction, where you consciously inhabit
  your own body and show up with the best of your attention, oﬀering your
  presence as a gi. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjksp65ac3cm0e0y9n4cek0x))
- Questions to Consider
  How do you show that you are here with your partners?
  How could you be more present when you are with your partners?
  Are there ways that you could be more available and responsive to your
  partners?
  How do your partners demonstrate that they are being present with
  you?
  Do you trust that your partners will be available and responsive if and
  when you need them?
  Are there things that your partners could do that would enhance your
  sense that they are here with you when you are together and here for
  you in general? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjksz73hyxb5tgsca8qs3757))
- Prioritize regular time with your partners when you are both fully here
  and present with each other. is is especially important when you only
  get limited time together, but it is just as important when you live
  together and spend a lot of time in each other’s company, but are not
  actually connecting without the distractions of kids, house, work, pets,
  meals, etc. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkt0npwgqmvxe8m3gqfpv57))
- Brown and Elliot describe expressed
  delight as one of the foundational elements of secure attachment.70 When a
  parent shows pleasure not just in the things that their child does, but in who
  their child is, a positive sense of self and healthy self-esteem are fostered in
  the child. As adults, expressed delight is also needed to promote secure
  attachment and a healthy sense of self within the relationship. When our
  partners are able to articulate the ways that we are special and valuable to
  them, our interpersonal self-worth is supported. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkt3t0x53qg6nwawqxzsgdk))
- Diane Poole Heller and her colleagues use the term beam gleam (also
  known as the attachment gaze) to refer to the nonverbal expression of
  warmth, kindness and love that radiates from our eyes, letting our partners
  know that they are special to us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkt4tmeqjgarx1raq5b17fw))
- e paradigm shi
  from the monogamous mindset of I am with you because you are the only
  one for me to the nonmonogamous view that I am with you because you are
  special and unique, but not the only one, can be diﬃcult to grasp. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkt5nzh4839np7vd2xhpm29))
- Even when people have a healthy sense of self and esteem,
  they still need positive feedback as to why their partners cherish them and
  choose to be with them, especially when, theoretically, they can choose to be
  with many others. ere is nothing wrong with needing to hear why you are
  wanted and valued by your partners and it is important for you to be able to
  communicate to your partners why they speci cally matter to you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkt77qdzepqpyac8stb8crm))
- Attuning to a partner does not mean that
  you have to agree with them and take on their experience as your own, but it
  does mean that you are willing to join them in their internal emotional
  world and their inner state of mind in order to empathize with what they are
  going through. Attunement is meeting your partner with curiosity, wanting
  to understand their feelings and needs. It is the feeling of being seen,
  understood and “gotten” by the other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkte64rysra6nnvtc84vgcm))
- ere are certain challenges with attunement that can surface in
  attachment-based relationships. ey include how to stay attuned to your
  partner when they are upset with you and how to stay attuned if you get
  triggered by them. In nonmonogamous relationships it can be additionally
  challenging to stay attuned to your partner when they are talking about one
  of their other partners, when jealousy arises or when the things they are
  sharing about others have implications for your relationship with them.
  When you are with multiple partners at the same time, you might also feel
  confusion around how to stay attuned to each of your partners. Just as the
  wants and needs of each relationship are diﬀerent, the ways that we attune to
  each of our partners can also be diﬀerent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjktg4nhy24hm9p81rny7yyy))
- Additionally, how partners say goodbye before one of them goes on a
  date with someone else or how they reunite aer having been with other
  partners can make a big diﬀerence in feeling safe and sound with each other.
  Some people don’t want much pomp and circumstance when saying
  goodbye, while others need moments of connection with each other before
  their partner goes oﬀ on a date with someone else. If partners live together,
  they may request that the partner who has been with someone else shower
  before coming to bed, they may desire emotional or physical contact aer
  being apart or they may prefer to sleep in separate rooms on date nights
  with others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjktn2xj099ac92nwvw9wmca))
- What are the routines my partners and I already have that are
  meaningful to me and support me in feeling safe and secure together? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdwp3b5sp55t9x7bs81ejye))
- Create bedtime or waking rituals with your partners, whether or not
  you live together. Make sure to also support and allow space for your
  nesting partners to create their own bedtime and waking rituals with
  other partners. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdwpc79x169cs5j2s2t1w4e))
- Also, be transparent with your partners about speci c activities or
  terms of endearment that are designated just for certain relationships.
  Some polyamorous people believe that you should never have certain
  things or places that only belong to one relationship, while other people
  have few qualms about this. I take the middle path on this issue
  because I don’t know if it is completely realistic to abolish all
  expressions of “what’s ours” from a relationship (some forms of couple
  identity can be very healthy in polyamory) and I’ve also seen the
  powerful healing eﬀect that can happen when people are allowed to ask
  for something they want to stay within a certain relationship. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkv3k9eny2rxhpy3yzxdf5a))
- Have a commitment ceremony with your partner. Currently in the
  United States, people can only get legally married to one person at a
  time, but there is nothing that stops you from having commitment
  ceremonies with other partners. You can create your own ceremony
  that you conduct together, you can have friends, family members,
  mentors or other partners oﬃciate a ceremony for you, or you can nd
  an oﬃciant friendly to nonmonogamy to help you co-create and
  perform a ceremony that is meaningful to you and your partners. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkv68x8bzd624amwdcx63dw))
- Even if we wanted to be, we can’t be perfectly present and
  attentive to our partners all the time, every time. What matters is not that we
  have ruptures, but how we repair them. When there is con ict and
  disagreement or when attunement and connection have been lost, it is how
  we repair and nd our way back to our partners that builds secure
  attachment and relational resilience. C ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkvaq7e2637w6f1m5em0av5))
- Couples that are described as the masters of relationships,
  versus what the Gottman Institute names the disasters of relationships, still
  experience episodes of yelling, being mean to each other, defensiveness,
  being critical or shutting down, but these couples are also willing to admit
  responsibility for their part in the con ict so they can begin the process of
  healing their bond. e masters of relationships are able to learn from what
  went wrong and see that repairing the relationship is more important than
  the problem itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkvkarn5ccnz5sbb5v43hq4))
- Repairs didn’t have to be perfectly executed as much as they had
  to be genuine. I oen tell couples and multiple-partner relationships that
  you can have all the communication techniques and con ict resolution skills
  in the world, but they do nothing if you still have an attitude of wanting to
  either be right or prove your partner wrong. I still recommend acquiring
  more communication and con ict resolution skills, but even without these,
  the right attitude—one of repair responsibility, humility and openness—goes
  far. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkvm1dd388s5k75fzjjzyaz))
- Being seen,
  understood, appreciated and loved by another who is turning towards you
  with their presence and warmth is invaluable in its potential to oﬀer the
  corrective attachment experiences that so many of us need. But healing
  attachment does not stop there. While I will not diminish the power that
  secure relationships with others have to heal our past and to bring alive our
  own secure ways, the establishment of a secure relationship with our self is
  needed to fully embody healthy attachment with others, so much so that it
  requires its own chapter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdwa0vq63p6f3tz9e2p38v3))
- —our
  primary relationship with our self can become severed and the development
  of certain capacities and skills can become compromised. Attachment
  ruptures and trauma can also leave lasting marks on our psyche, distorting
  our sense of self through the beliefs that we do not matter, that we are
  awed, broken, unworthy or too much while, simultaneously, not enough. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdwamxpwva6cvxkdsszp951))
- earned secure attachment. Meaningful contact with teachers,
  friends, lovers, mentors, therapists, or other relatives who can empathically

  develop earned secure attachment is through making sense of your story. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggdwk8e5dkbjpeda50c3d3sp))
