## Highlights

- A culture of reflection means considering “how to resolve conflict” instead of continuing to debate the disagreement. When we find ourselves or others in a conflict we should ask first about the situation, not about the disagreement.
  ***Community Tips:***
  • Encourage members to take on a perspective of curiosity. When conflict emerges, default to questions such as:
  • What would it look like to resolve this conflict?
  • Are we equipped to resolve the conflict? If not, do we need a mediator?
  • Who’s involved in this conflict?
  • Are we in the right space (place and time) to resolve this conflict?
  • Are we all aligned that resolving this conflict is in the interest of our community? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h73v047nsf8yr0c01qgnm6d2))
