- A lack of expressed sympathy or empathy may not be the result of a lack of emotion in someone who has autism, but rather due to underdeveloped skills. There are several elements involved in showing empathy to others.
  To connect with another person in these ways, one must:
  • Recognize the other person's feelings
  • Understand the other person's hopes, dreams, and/or expectations
  • Have the emotional experience to relate personally to another's feelings
  • Have the tools to physically and verbally express empathic feelings
  • Share a cultural understanding that displays of empathy are expected and desired
  People with autism who struggle to show empathy and sympathy may have difficulty with one or more of these. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn65chtts2kqj2fas0y7jweh))
