- On the one hand, she felt enormously proud of her contribution and relieved that her service on the regional Citizens’ Assembly was over. It had been painstaking work, a year-long crash course in ethics, ecology, and sociology. Weeks of debating and ultimately collaborating with people with whom she initially seemed to have little in common. Difficult tradeoffs to weigh, always. But ultimately they had done their part, as had thousands of other local, regional, and global councils — the mistakes of some compensated for by the wisdom of many others.

- little incentive or mechanism for achieving these goals. The goals would rely on charity and voluntary commitments. It’s no wonder then that progress over the first five years has been minimal and funding has been trillions of dollars short, while humanity slides past ever more ecological limits.

- collaboration is a key to reducing suffering and improving the human condition. For the first 15 years of my career, I worked from the assumption that if I could help make collaboration easier and faster, social good would be the emergent result.

- even those who questioned whether there had been a dangerous outbreak at all — added to it. A compendium of complex, conflicting information. The technology didn’t eliminate differences of opinion, but it facilitated productive dialog, managed debate, and built consensus; and like its primitive ancestor Wikipedia, it gave an imperfect but still fairly sharp picture of our global collective intelligence. This process of making sense of the world made politicized briefings and cable news pundits look like the ancient relics they had now become.

- Social media companies, in turn, made billions spreading lies and innuendo about these well-meaning experts. But this time, the experts were of the people’s choosing. We each had placed our trust in the most informed, high-integrity friends, acquaintances, and leaders in our own circles, who in turn had given their trust to yet more informed experts through a well-honed “liquid democracy” process ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6f93yq429ejwmabs1cbmdpt))

    - Note: deep, sustainable change can only occur when oppressed communities themselves can design, own and govern the systemic solutions to their problems. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- The myth of today’s system is that it’s simple, even natural. People have needs. Other people meet those needs. Everyone’s free, and the Invisible Hand makes the world go round. In reality, if a child were to ask me about our current economic system, it will be mind-numbingly complicated to explain. They could truly understand its design only after adopting a constellation of man-made social constructs: private ownership, “money” as abstract wealth, compensation based on extraction rather than creation of net value, compound interest as a reward for debt-creation, taxation, the Leviathan state as property enforcer, the “fractional reserve banking” [Ponzi](https://bytemaster.github.io/article/2015/01/15/Is-Fractional-Reserve-Banking-a-Ponzi-Scheme/) scheme. And I would fail entirely at explaining why people tolerate what its structure requires and generates: [artificial scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_scarcity), [artificial demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_demand) (today’s global-scale brainwashing by corporations), unnatural poverty, rampant inequality ([a mathematical inevitability](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-inequality-inevitable/) of free markets), and utterly unsustainable consumption of resources ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6q9zv5nsekxegd1dykbcrvn))

- We propose putting the governance and ownership of technology in the hands of all people. Algorithms and AI can become our allies in translating our human values and aspirations into executable work, aiding our collective intelligence and allowing us to do more with less pressure on our planet ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6fa04dm2q7v8cvyvp53etsd))
- Imagine an accessible, user-friendly website and mobile app, built as a commons-based open-source platform cooperative, that allows any community to govern itself through collective intelligence, productive deliberation, and intelligent resource distribution. It’s informed by the visionary work of existing practitioners of liquid democracy, citizen assemblies, trust networks, participatory budgeting, [open-source designs for local manufacturing](https://www.cosmolocalism.eu/), and circular economies, to name just a few. It is decentralized and secure thanks to protocols like Holochain. If such technology feels far off, consider that collectives across the world are already building prototypes of platforms that provide these services and more. In 2020, Taiwan gracefully managed its COVID outbreak through digital democracy tools that built trust and leveraged citizen participation in ways similar to the stories we told above.

These may be communities of place, like villages, towns, cities — including some of the hundreds of new cities that will soon be needed by climate refugees.

- Once we’re up and running, any community could set shared goals to work toward, agree upon equitable incentive systems, distribute work fairly, scale collective sensemaking, and build bonds of trust. All of these activities are social and human-centered: they’re about people, connecting with people. But their effectiveness can be vastly amplified through the types of real-time communication, information processing, and data sensing that were nearly inconceivable just 30 years ago, but are commonplace today. It is heartening to see that just as quickly as our current systems seem to be failing, our capabilities to replace them are growing.
