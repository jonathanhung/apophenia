- Archipelago is one of my favourite games but I hesitate to call it art. Mostly, because I don't think it really manages to make use of the medium's inherent features as well as it could. I do think it treats theme and mechanics as seriously as any designer's game should, which is why it probably resonates with people who care about board games. While arguably in the tradition of classic eurogames like Settlers of Catan, it doesn't bend its non-specific setting to serve the game's playability or usability. But it also doesn't follow in the footsteps of thematic simulation by attempting to capture verisimilitude through painstakingly detailed special rules. 
  What makes Archipelago stand out is that there is a driving idea behind the design, a coherent vision about what play is supposed to feel like and explore. I find the game endlessly engaging, because it isn't about discovering robust strategies as you jockey for VP. Sure, you *can* do that, but the game isn't about winning by yourself. It's about establishing and developing an economic system that - although inherently exploitative - also manages to function long enough to reach any one of its goals. The point where it almost becomes art, to my understanding, is how so many of the dynamics at the table and in the game, can be used to look at today's society (or ourselves, if you allow the pretentious sentiment). From leveraging unemployment to drive down wages to the personal in-fighting of those at the top being the biggest contributor to social unrest. 
  I feel that the game is brimming with social commentary, but misses its mark in that when it concludes any and all failure is always put on either the "fragile player dynamics" or "kingmaking"... and never on the inherently capricious social system that Archipelago aims to criticize.
