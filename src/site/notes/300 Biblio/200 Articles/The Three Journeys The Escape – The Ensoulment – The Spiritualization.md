- The first challenge is to notice and hear this inner voice in the face of a crowding noise and inveigling pressure to fit in and conform to the ways of the world. The persuasive expectations and demands of the prevailing paradigms and values represent distancing and separating vectors from natural intuition and one’s inner essence.

- people discover a sense of inner emptiness, right at a high point of achievement, just as they received a recognition, an award, and are promoted.
  For some it appears with a sense welling up inside that “this” cannot be all there is, that there must be more to life and living. This is the propulsion that activates Journey One — the initial escape and quest to find a bigger purpose, possibility, and meaning in living. The intuition and yearning impulse that the game of life must involve a much bigger prospect are awakened in people in many different ways.

- What we are seeking to find, consciously or unconsciously, is a Source to help us open a new way of seeing the world — a perspective that will put into context the confusing and even bewildering experiences of living. We are seeking an elevated viewpoint, a perception that can place what we feel, see, and experience inside a map of meaning that makes sense and empowers us.

- This is Journey One. The escape, the quest, the pilgrimage to find a higher source. Variations of this journey have been taken by people from the beginning of time, before the modern world, in traditional, monastic, and communal settings and in untraditional and adventurous ways.
  The modern and then the postmodern world sought to adapt and package new approaches to this journey. Initially it was mostly lineage based. The late 19th century and early 20th century brought new teachers, ways, and paths, at first into the fringe and then into the mainstream. There were always the more esoteric streams in each of the main traditional faiths that presented their attraction through exclusive knowledge, ecstatic prayer, and exotic communal rituals and worship.
  Over the last several decades in the New Age and the personal growth space, alternative and novel ways emerged and became increasingly more distributed and situationally customized. These include development workshops, silence retreats, dance festivals, and healing, somatic, and communal experiences, and practices.

- The identification trap arises in and through a profound experience or a succession of such experiences with a teacher, a community, an ecology of practice, or a domain that opened possibilities and stirred a deep sense of resonance. We get excited, even mesmerized with the access that’s opening and the capabilities switching on in us, that we fall in love with the experience and identify with it and with the phenomena and natures accompanying it.
  ![](https://portalsofperception.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-1-12.jpg)We may feel that we’ve made a huge leap, a leap that’s completely transformed everything about us. We might imagine we are now joined to Source or even became a source of possibility and light for others around us. These can be genuine facets of the encounter. The trap arises when we identify with the experience and develop a big head about it. At that point we are no longer inside the expanding discovery and the communion but rather inside our heads telling ourselves stories of self-importance and aggrandizement about the experience.

    - Note: describes a trap where we mistake encountering a new vantage point with embodying the transformation that this knowledge opens. 
      I certainly connect with the idea: NVC, meditation, design futures, co-operatives. Easy to say not part of the practice. [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
