- Don't believe me?
  [Raphael Arar](https://twitter.com/rarar?lang=en) is proof. A designer and researcher at IBM, Arar epitomizes the style and multi-disciplinary skill set of the modern designer. Among other things, Arar designs for the digital experiences we have with conversational agents (or chatbots), where he pulls in elements from a variety of disciplines to make our conversations with machines feel more real.
  Arar's depth of understanding in things like Conversation Analysis, a real scientific field that studies social interactions, may be surprising to many people. That's because he might not sound like the kind of designer you're used to.
  "When we communicate emotion, you can say certain things that convey meaning that might not be in the words that you choose, but rather, in the way that you respond." he said, when describing his work. "I can say something like 'It's a pretty nice day, isn't it?' And if the recipient pauses, it signifies a negation, that you disagree, and you can look at these signifiers in a variety of contexts."
  Because we're having more digital experiences that are [conversational](https://www.inc.com/yazin-akkawi/why-emotional-intelligence-is-far-more-valuable-th.html) (rather than swipes and taps), an understanding of sociology and psychology are table stakes for designers like Arar.
  Unconventional Career Paths
  Arar's academic background may also be surprising to non-designers. During his undergrad, he studied behavioral economics and music composition. Thereafter, he completed his MFA, where he explored interactions in an aesthetic and philosophical way.
  Although he admits that he's had an unconventional path to design, each point has been a culmination, however seemingly unrelated, of his work as a designer today.
  "It makes sense when I look back on my path." he says. "Behavioral economics is the understanding of incentive structures of humans, and music composition, I think, equates to user experiences--to compose music is to create an experience that is time-based and one that guides the listener."
  But Arar is not alone in his winding path to design. Many of today's digital designers, [myself included](http://www.mstq.io), come from very diverse backgrounds, with fewer designers emerging from actual design school. In fact, a recent [report](https://designintechreport.wordpress.com/2017/03/11/design-in-tech-report-2017/) found that 86 percent of designers develop their digital skills outside of their coursework, and instead are learning best-practices on the job.
