- here is no one-size-fits-all to mutual learning and in a simplistic reduction, it involves at least two separate communities engaging in feedback loops of exchange for the purposes of developing a shared understanding in order to produce a beneficial outcome. That outcome could be as simple and straightforward as the sharing of ideas, or it could be more complex and include the creation of a new public asset like an open-source online library or a place-based community garden.

- As facilitator(s), you must have a vague idea as to why you chose to engage in mutual learning. The question then ensues: what do you hope to learn? Design is often goal-directed;[2](javascript:void(0))Redström, Johan. Making Design Theory. United Kingdom: MIT Press, 2017. however, the notion of anti-goals can be a goal in itself. In other words, how might the identification of goals be an emergent part of a co-creative feedback loop? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h80gmtsevc75jf1kx58sds30))
- Framing can help direct an inquiry, whether that’s aesthetic or functional. There’s a continuum to play with here: broad vs. narrow. Consider these as ontological boundaries, a creative and intellectual playground devised for mutual learning ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h80h01j68bx45n3fdrya5x8m))
- Traditionally local hubs have been forced to leverage digital tools to cultivate relationships. We’re increasingly in a post site-specific era, and as a result, our sense of community can extend beyond the confines of geographic barriers. The potential for global inclusivity is easier now than ever before. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h80gnm466hmfm4zx58hqzmes))
- From Paolo Freire to bell hooks, discourse around critical pedagogy seeks to dismantle power relations both in and out of the classroom.[4](javascript:void(0))Freire, Paulo. Pedagogy of the oppressed. New York: Seabury Press, 1970. hooks, bell. Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom. United Kingdom: Routledge, 1994. How might we engage one another in a dialectical process and cultivate a sense of belonging? In online spaces, we are often confined to boxes, restricted by the dimensionality of a grid. Grids have a time and place; however, what they gain in form and order, they lose in relationality and the balance of power dynamics in a group. When convening, there are many ways to “circle” and much of this practice stems from its origins in restorative justice.[5](javascript:void(0))Coates, Roberts, Mark Umbreit, and Betty Vos. “Restorative justice circles: An exploratory study.” *Contemporary Justice Review* 6, no. 3 (2003): 265-278. When convening through a digital platform, consider how to circle starting with a moment of mindfulness to allow participants to check in with themselves in order to check in with others and both express needs and the manners in which participants prefer to engage ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h80gqt3hd37qx79x8dbxtjxy))
- A probe is a method that can catalyze creative inquiry. The crux of it includes the inclusion of a provocative artifact (e.g., an object, a map, a textual passage) coupled with a set of actions (e.g., reflect, consider, play) and a (set of) prompts that encourage participants to record and/or reflect on those actions. Originally conceived as a design method to open up a space,[7](javascript:void(0))Gaver, Bill, Tony Dunne, and Elena Pacenti. “Design: cultural probes.” *interactions*  6, no. 1 (1999): 21-29. generate ideas and facilitate dreaming, it has evolved and mutated in countless ways based on the containers of content and context.

- Describing how to make in the context of mutual learning and cultural exchange is paradoxical. On the one hand, the act of making is itself the most concrete of any of these steps, yet describing “how to make” is perhaps the most open-ended of these steps, since it is abstract and capable of many different interpretations. Asking to define how a group engages in making is akin to asking “what is art?” and “what constitutes an artistic practice?” For these reasons, this step is intended to be left open-ended; however, what is paramount is that a group engages in making. This could be any number of things (e.g., writing, cooking, designing), and similar to the step on probes, occurrences can be either asynchronous or synchronous. Especially when conducted digitally, consider making with augmented tools. What kinds of technologies can be introduced to add layers of experimentation? How might generative tools enhance or detract from the process? How might computational collaborators be additive in the making process? Consider these opportunities that digital platforms afford while being aware of their limitations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h80gth9wh3jc3kyn9235m0xx))
