- the need to be instruments versus instrumental or instrumentalized ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaa090dc23m35pwfvk6tt4h))
- one of the problems is that is is of this time is disembodiment and much of what he wrote about was about Incarnation and even what he called carnality and the need to be bodies uh so so that was one thought I had while you were speaking
  um the other thing about the Samaritan and and chance and and the the fact that we live in this society that tries to control everything through through technology to the point where we become what gertchev called machine man and we don't we don't see our neighbor ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaa1pwzygyzax8cm1yrbv0c))
- this looking to Nature so that we kind of get back to being really being human right so that we can know how to pay attention ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaa2rbzh9v5efx30q8sj26c))
    - Note: Is this over romantic? We are machine men, global interconnected beings [[800 Seeds/810 Unsorted Notes/fleeting-note\|fleeting-note]]
- Simone Bay who basically it was like if
  we really paid attention like for her attention is metaphysically and ontologically loaded it's not merely to look at something it's to give yourself over to the thing entirely and let the thing give itself to you entirely and for her this is basically kind of at the center of the religious life like if one is incapable of attention then one is probably incapable of spiritual resonance or something deeper now this would speak to why it would be very problematic if we have um technology today that removes the ability to have attention really because we're so moving
  around that we can't focus on anything and that would suggest a certain loss of a spiritual dimension of reality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaa7q4q8aaz9r2b545yphq0))
- I think he resisted because then if you say oh God is something I can know through say rationality there are no limits to you you just have to you can always potentially access more of God and more of God and more of God right and you're it's all right here right in this current moment of space and time but if there's something about God in the world then you need to leave your home you need to go to the neighbor there's a limit to the moment that you have to extend in order to access God or the Divine ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaabvmk2b93zxeeey1d7hb8))
- so if we're going to speak about God is Incarnate then we have to think about God and the spiritual by extension as this very multi-dimensional interpenetrating interrelating way of existence that entails um acorns and Lilies of the Field and birds but also entails The Mystery of the ability to speak the mystery of how when people are in a room there's a field or atmosphere of people being together ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaae5ptfg4658ym42xw49p4))
- that's also going to set limits on what we can know outside of relation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaaegftt287db4b1fgt5x00))
- humans basically are miserable go crazy or existentially overwhelmed when there are no givenness to reality when anything is possible because if anything is possible how do you choose X versus y by what standard ah you either have you're you're already
  right there vulnerable to looking to the system or a strong man or the totalitarian to tell you what you should choose ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaahqpcmrn5yrxnkgp0jw1k))
- we've replaced the spirit with system a way I think about it illich is he's really emphasizing over like the Holy Spirit really like kind of following the spirit paying attention to it almost more so than the father he does obviously talk about Jesus a lot but there's this kind of like sense of things that goes back
  to this tradition of the like praying meditating the spirit should I use technology this way or not and kind of having that and when and for mostly human history you could say what we've done is basically relied on Gibbons now of course the problem is belonging again tells us is that that made us susceptible to the banality of evil that Hannah Arden talks about thoughtlessness being controlled and so on and so forth so for very good reason we deconstructed those Givens the problem is we kind of assume that removing limits would be the
  answer like if oh if we just make humans have access to limit limitlessness then we're good to go well actually unfortunately what ends up happening is in that state that is unprepared for limitlessness we then turn to the corporation the system the state the government we just fall right back into various strong men or all the different like the education system tells us what to think as he talks about we we come to assume the dominance or the written word and the ways to think about it as he talks about on his book ABC and different things so today the challenge
  is how to choose limits how to set limits on ourselves or discern lemons that aren't given that is a very difficult practice but Ivan Ilitch is absolutely aware aware aware of the need to do that and we can see books and his thinking of kind of wrestling with choosing limits again as opposed to limits just being given so you can say that's the difference in the past limits were more given today they have to be chosen well that's an entirely different ball again ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaammx3q1g32e12eqq32zxc))
- seem to be putting some Royal Gauntlet down about it and you're not right
  you're just saying okay this is not functioning like I have other things I really need to do and I really like this so I actually have to limit myself with that because otherwise I won't be able to feel good actually like yes I like that and it feels nice watching that but it doesn't feel nice when I realize oh my gosh like an hour and a half or two hours or three hours has passed by and I really needed to do all these other things so now you've put a limitation on that but but it's hard because see in the past either there was a moral there was a moral constraint and not on television necessarily maybe but on lots
  of different sexuality or sexuality and right and those things and in some ways at least you could put this like if you didn't like it you could at least sort of blame it on like oh well it's a religion I like I have to you know I can't do this because of this and the other but you also were not you didn't have the option to you know you well you did have the option to to dissent right and maybe do something differently but you kind of always had the it was always the thing the out the other thing the it was the religion that made you not want to do it or do something different or it made you do the thing right it made you stay within those confines of that
  limitation now that if that's not there right you have to make these these choices of doing it or not and it's not necessarily based on morality per se but it's based on what what you find is most functional for you or what is in a way optimizes your well you know being in the world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaasnpfjkxmytnwpyc72gz8))
- everyone who sees what you decide they think they could
  take it as a moral judgment on what they decide to do or not do and you're kind of in this sort of like complete Flux Of it's basically a kind of I want to say an uncertainty ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaav3hmkrr9z2mcp70smj3j))
- guess you have to just either get really really um confident like in yourself and in what you discern in attending to what
  you know is going to work better for you or not and then doing it and just not really caring what other people are doing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaavf8zen9tffn2d5gesswx))
- the other thing is that people may just go back to certain Givens uh that they find they believe in or they they lines up with their values enough that they were like yes I'll just go ahead and choose these these limitations but the fact that you had to choose it at all is always very existential ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaawhbzhwcf88kg2pxkbpsv))
- amusing ourselves to death and what's interesting with that image like you were saying with the TV is you know people will talk about love languages face-to-face shoulder to shoulder well traditionally if you were shoulder to shoulder you were working on a car working on a TV it was an active social um it was an active shoulder to shoulder now you have this kind of passive shoulder to shoulder that seems quite different that can create this kind of Vanishing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaby95cct8ae04r740zcm6w))
- is the moment the camera is invented every tree is a potential photograph even if you don't have a camera you know you
  could buy one and thus take a picture right every party you go to every moment of it could be a photograph or could be a tweet and so your relation to everything in reality with every technology changes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdabzj0xarhckbb7htd7j5ye))
- everyone doesn't want to be seen as not caring or
  not tweeting and everything's a potential content so then the technology what it over there's no limit it overtakes ethic plus possible quality equals Limitless engagement with the technology and it ceases to be an instrument and instead instrumentalizes us ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdac0r2wjjr5kascrdt23jsc))
- people are either instrumentalized or they just let the system think for them because it's too tiring it's too overwhelming and so then they get you know controlled ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdac1m1mnzqtbba8dm2nyr6q))
- some of the great things about religion would be that it would provide those things for people and they often were tied to the flesh like you know in terms of you know like for at least for females becoming a mother or things like this ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdac47t869xqyb2ezg90f3j0))
- Neil Postman basically in his book The Disappearance of childhood says an adult is someone who's literate right like you go like if you're illiterate you're an adult right well now being an adult means you have a career and you have a job right and or you participate in the system in a certain way ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdac8z5z3q6798k4eqhre4s0))
- the issue is that systems have a tendency to
  do your thinking for you illit is not anti-technology ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdac9d400tagpgd605gv1fwc))
- we get captured in this
  thinking that you're either for the system or you're against it and as a result There's No Limit there's no decision there's no choice there's no personal customization and in that situation of which of course is existentially very difficult ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdaccyjecmd34jw8dqrt8b29))
- there's this real emphasis today that everything is bothness right that the Republicans have truth but the Democrats have truth as well freedom is important but equality is important as well there's always this kind of bothness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdacdc997g7t3dp99d2tdw91))
- the question is the proportion of that bothness and where you make the choice in the midst of that both Nest is it 40 freedom and 60 equality or is it 70
  freedom and thirty percent equality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdacdq6319fjtfhf4g3h30jp))
- the Baseline of thought is most people even on the street I think would say that it's both like they're going to say we need both you'll hear that it's both both everyone is right in different ways okay well if that's the Baseline now the question is the organization and choice of the relation of that bothness and Ivan Ilitch understood that like he is constantly putting forth a need to make a choice so that our tools are instruments as opposed to instrumentalizing us ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdacfccjk8zjmv8w3k5kp589))
- what's the difference between extending humanity and replacing humanity and we're of the opinion that a lot of it has to do with the question of motivation like if
  you're paying attention to yourself like are you motivated to do X because of an external Prize or because you see some sort of inherent value in doing that thing it's kind of like Nietzsche's child like this is good to do for its own sake ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdacnjkttn8hsjkvas031q86))
- determining our relation with our tools has something to do with paying attention to the very experience of our motivations really looking at them and sort of gauging if we are doing this for a motivation that's going to lead to instrument or instrumentalizing ourselves ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdacq4ek7341zd89ypawxb30))
- he may have never written down this kind of these
  Master ideas in his thinking until the end of his life he was willing to let the ideas pass through him well right there what you see is an illick this kind of awareness of a need to sense the motivation am I doing this for the right reason am I thinking that I have to put these ideas in the world or the world will end it's all up to me well that's not a good motivation because you have a savior mentality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdacs0j2rvb36hxgznnzgjcz))
- some different paradigms about how people think about children but ultimately they are very much in the
  world right they're very much in the moment they're not thinking about you know they're not worrying about the future they might be excited about or ask you about like Wednesday Christmas how many days until Christmas or whatever it is but they're very very present they they they're so present that they don't really know what date is ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdacwpnydrt98tqfp55vkhzr))
