## Highlights

- Magnesium deficiency depresses the immune response and the activity of the 300 other enzymatic pathways in the body that rely on it as a cofactor. ([21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/49413/)) Your clients may benefit from supplementation with 300 to 400 mg of magnesium glycinate per day to support their magnesium status. Also, encourage them to eat magnesium-rich foods such as dark leafy greens, almonds, avocados, pumpkin seeds, cashews, and cacao/dark chocolate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge4xgde9krx0e7gvht5q32s1))
- Metabolomics research indicates that Lyme disease is associated with changes in the metabolism of tryptophan, an amino acid. **Rather than being metabolized to serotonin, tryptophan is diverted towards the production of neuroinflammatory metabolites.** ([38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6093930/)) Vitamin B6 helps redirect the process, converting tryptophan into serotonin. Vitamin B6 is abundant in salmon, eggs, chicken liver, beef, sweet potatoes, bananas, chickpeas, and avocados ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge4xd2zgsjpva9t34trtegrn))
- Choline, a vitamin-like nutrient, is also critical for cognition. It has anti-inflammatory actions in the brain and is associated with higher cognitive performance. ([39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579609/)) Choline is found primarily in egg yolks, beef liver, and chicken liver; it is present in smaller amounts in cruciferous vegetables and lentils ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge4xcpg297q4ehsh0hmcw7rw))
- Cinnamon and oregano extracts have been found to inhibit the production of *Borrelia* biofilm. ([43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641543/)) Garlic oils and hydroxytyrosol, a phenolic phytochemical in olive oil, inhibit the growth of “persister” *Borrelia* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge4xfd0ddv2fh1jmcajtpq9p))
- AIP is an extension of the Paleo diet. In addition to eliminating grains, legumes, industrial seed oils, and refined sugar, it eliminates foods that can trigger intestinal inflammation and food intolerance, including coffee, dairy, eggs, nuts and seeds, nightshade vegetables, and alcohol ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ge4xe2pjv9506st10420z5gx))
