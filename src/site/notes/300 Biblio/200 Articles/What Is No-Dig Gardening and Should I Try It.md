- No-Dig May Not Be a Quick Fix Normally we start a garden bed wanting to plant right away but that’s not always possible. For a garden with hard, compact soil that is difficult to dig and grow in, switching to no-dig will take time. You’ll need to smother existing grass or weeds (with a layer of cardboard or something similar) and bring in loads of compost and mulch. One quicker option is created raised beds instead. They too can be no-dig and more budget-friendly than amending larger garden beds. With enough depth, they are ready to plant as soon as they have good compost and soil. It May Take a Lot of Mulch To Get Started While it sounds great not to have turn, till, or dig soil, in some cases we may be exchanging one big job for another. No-dig requires the addition of compost or mulch to top dress the garden beds. For a larger area this could require many yards of mulch at great cost to the management. Not to mention the time and effort to distribute it. For me, I still feel like I’m saving time and energy by not digging because either way I would need to add organic matter to my pathetic (super sandy, unfertile) soil each year ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8g6t6wk4jk39qn9rz9pdhps))

  You’ll need to smother existing grass or weeds (with a layer of cardboard or something similar) and bring in loads of [compost](https://empressofdirt.net/composting-for-gardeners-101/) and mulch. The degradation of that cardboard and the work of all those earthworms, microbials, and so on, will take time.

  No-dig requires the addition of compost or mulch to top dress the garden beds. My rototilling neighbors prefer synthetic fertilizers instead of compost, which comes with various environmental concerns.
  Establishing a large no-dig garden could require many yards of mulch at great cost to the management—buying mulch is definitely my most expensive garden expense by far. Not to mention the time and effort to distribute it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8g6v9j127cvs22p0qgmvens))
