- The essential principle of grotesque realism is degradation, the lowering of all that is abstract, spiritual, noble, and ideal to the material level. Through the use of the grotesque body in his novels, Rabelais related political conflicts to human [anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy). In this way, Rabelais used the concept as "a figure of unruly biological and social exchange".[[1\|1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grotesque_body#cite_note-1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcbgnfjxk45zkj3gmjdrk98s))
