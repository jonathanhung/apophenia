## Highlights 
---
- Shallow alignment is low-stakes, easy to achieve, and fits neatly on a slide. Deep alignment embraces the idea that multiple, sometimes conflicting, values and truths exist. It is messy and requires people to agree to disagree.
  Shallow alignment avoids tension. Deep alignment inherently involves tension and friction, hence why deep alignment requires psychological safety, time to diverge, and time to get real.
  Shallow alignment is expensive to maintain and crushes creativity. Deep alignment is strategic, resilient, empowering, and complex.
  Alignment is not a checkbox. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9ey5psre11ckwtwde8y68gd))
