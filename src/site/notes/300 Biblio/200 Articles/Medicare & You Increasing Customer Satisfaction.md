- Our team worked to modernize the *Medicare & You* handbook section which allowed for adding photos in the header, narrowing down the selection options, and making those options clearer and more distinct. In addition to making the page visually look better, it aligned the designs with the CMS Medicare Design System, improved accessibility, and created a cleaner usability path for the end-users. This approach notably resulted in an 18% increase of the existing customer satisfaction score (CSAT). Previously the page had a less intuitive set-up that was not conducive to finding the appropriate version of the handbook. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ezyx9n5ngnh7wmy5whxqh9))
