- I noticed a general tendency to view all potential relationships not merely as anxiety-inducing, but as sites of possible betrayal. Many students reported loneliness while describing a feeling that people were only seeking transactional benefits, that closeness was intrinsically extractive, and that the risk of being used, abandoned, or mistreated was an obstacle to enjoying the kind of pleasant camaraderie typically associated with residential undergraduate life.

- I was reminded that closeness—not dissociative hanging-out-because-you’re-afraid-to-be-alone kind, and not the transactional socializing of people hoping to get something from one another—but real so-close-you-can-smell-the-decomposition-and-the-sweetness intimacy is both what I want and what I need to feel less alone.

- I still experience other people as an inconvenience. The clerk at CVS takes too long. My elderly downstairs neighbor’s TV is too loud. When I meditate and try to notice everything nonjudgmentally, the neighbor’s TV stops being annoying, the murmurs of the news, no more, no less. But when I am trying to write or read, the sounds annoy me again. Loneliness is partly what it’s like to be a subject in an economic system where your emotional needs are either externalities to be minimized or incentives to be fused with commerce in an architecture of exploitation and extraction.

- I encountered two new books this spring that discuss the abolition of the family with varying explicitness, one by therapist and activist M. E. O’Brien, bluntly called *Family Abolition*, and another, historian Kristen R. Ghodsee’s *Everyday Utopia* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hab305444en8veshdpa6d8bv))
- One thing Ghodsee helped me see is that people actually flourish with high levels of interconnection, whether in residential, educational, care, or labor settings, cooperatives, collectives, or cohousing settings. It’s simple and, when stated plainly, seems obvious. It’s also an idea that’s subtly but constantly disabused in our culture. Who hasn’t encountered the anxiety that any residential arrangement with spiritual, communal, or radical ties may be a cult that impinges on sacred secular individuality and its business partner (private property)? 
  Ghodsee notes that people often mythologize college as the best years of their life, partly because they get to live close to others, learn, and prioritize relationships. Working with college students—many of whom tell me that their primary tool for alleviating stress is being alone and watching TikTok—I wonder if they will mythologize these years. When they come to talk to me about their loneliness, I’m supposed to ask them nonjudgmental questions. I’m not supposed to tell them, “It’s systemic, you’re lonely because the system is broken. Another world is possible.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hab31k4km5062jajgdknz4ch))

- There’s redemption in the insufficiency of individual solutions; it means that the presence of loneliness isn’t due to a failure of personal ingenuity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hab332t7jqkjtg6b80vzfjt0))
