- an age that values the will to power over physical environment above all other things, without any sense of the mystery of being, the piety of not trying to grasp and control and reduce all of reality to instrumentality and utility.
  He tells a very powerful story about the genealogy of Western nihilism, how we arrived at what he calls the age of technology, in which everything is simply a project of the will, and the whole of the world is nothing but a reserve of resources to be exploited for the purpose of acquisition and for the purposes of the will. Now, I don’t agree with the whole story, but as I say, it makes one think about the genealogy of the way we see the world and see the world as desacralized and disenchanted.

- So, is it reason or is it faith that determines when an argument from reason or an argument from faith is appropriate?
  **HART:** Reason.
  **COWEN:** Reason? Reason is the bottom line?
  **HART:** It has to be, because even if you choose faith, you’re choosing to believe something for a reason. Even if you’re not able to name those reasons yourself, some compelling rational intuition has worked upon you to say, “Well, I believe I can trust this source more than that source.” You may say that, “Oh, I’m having faith in what it’s telling me,” but you’re having faith in *that* rather than something else, because at some level — maybe a tacit level that you have a hard time laying out — you’ve somehow reached the judgment.

- The American philosopher [William James spoke of the will to believe](https://godandgoodlife.nd.edu/digital-essays/the-will-to-believe/), and he’s often misunderstood as if all he was saying was it’s okay to choose arbitrarily to believe something. That’s not what he said. What he said was, if you’re in the fog, say, and you encounter two paths, and you have a sense that one is more likely to lead to safety and the other to the edge of a cliff, you take that path. But you don’t take it so credulously that you’ll walk off the edge of a cliff if you come to the cliff.
  The act of faith is a way of *engaging* the mind, *engaging* reason so it can explore. If you don’t start with some trust of the possibility of discovering the truth, then you never will seek the truth to begin with. That search requires a combination of a degree of rational judgment *and* a degree of trust, and you hope that the two prove to be in harmony. If they’re not, though, if you reach a point where your faith and your reason come into conflict, then trust your reason.
  Always trust your reason because otherwise, faith is just [epistemic nihilism](https://www.colinmcginn.net/epistemic-nihilism/). It’s meaningless. It’s just a brute exertion of the will, at which point it’s subrational and becomes contemptible. Always trust reason, *but* make sure that reason is tempered. It’s not petty rationalism, but it’s a reason that really can see things in broad perspective and understand in a variety of modalities. Don’t treat reason as if it’s a math equation.

- In the United States, has progressive politics become the new version of a secular Christianity?
  **HART:** Well, I don’t know. In some cases yes, in some cases not. It depends on what you’re talking about in particular. I think, in America, but also in the West as such — just to a pathological degree in America, on both right and left — we’ve learned to start all of our conversations from a position of moral absolutism.
  I don’t know if this has always been the case. There have been apocalyptic moments in American history before. We had a Civil War, for instance. But at the present, it seems like both extremes speak in such strident tones of moral indignation that it is tempting to think that they’re speaking out of a dogmatic impulse rather than a rational one, that there is a religious intonation, in the worst sense, in our politics on all sides.

- Whereas *my* ideal of what would be a brighter future for Christianity would be the final eclipse of that kind of conflation of Christianity with the interests of a particular civilization or culture or nation. I believe that’s a perfidious corruption. So, bright in what way? I would say that in many ways, the brightest future for Christianity may consist in the death of many of its institutions and of much of its cultural power.

- [*The Truman Show*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/), which is just a pure gnostic allegory.
  **COWEN:** Sure.
  **HART:** [*Gattaca*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/), done by the same fellow.
  **COWEN:** Sure.
  **HART:** Television, too, as far as I know. Actually, I said I don’t watch enough to know, but I did a few years ago. What was the program? [*Battlestar Galactica*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407362/), the sci-fi version. I actually got hooked on that and watched it through, and there are plenty of gnostic themes in that.
  **COWEN:** But they ruined the ending in the final season ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcbw30yjttpmdkrrd4xce9tz))
- **COWEN:** What’s the outstanding theological problem that you think about the most?
  **HART:** Relations with other faiths. I think that we need radically to rethink the very category of religion that we’ve inherited in the modern age, this anthropological notion that these are systems of propositions opposed to one another, rather than, as the ancient view would be, religion was a virtue that all human beings practiced in greater or lesser degree with greater or lesser understanding.
  For instance, I don’t write much theology anymore, but when I do, even if it’s Christian theology, I’m quite happy to draw on Vedantic sources from India if they illuminate a question for me. I think we do have to rethink what exactly it is we’re talking about when we talk about religion.
  The other thing, I guess, because I published that book a couple years ago, [*That* *All Shall Be Saved*](https://www.amazon.com/That-All-Shall-Saved-Universal-ebook/dp/B07X8BRSM2/ref=sr_1_4?crid=D9XPNBL5YCZD&keywords=david+bentley+hart&qid=1688485945&sprefix=david+bentley+hart%2Caps%2C79&sr=8-4), is Christians radically need to rethink, and go back to the original text, and go back to the first century and rethink this [grotesque notion of an eternal hell](https://www.abc.net.au/religion/david-bentley-hart-obscenity-of-belief-in-eternal-hell/13356388).
