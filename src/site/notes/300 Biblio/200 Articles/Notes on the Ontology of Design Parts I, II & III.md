- it is still unclear whether these works can be considered to constitute a field of ‘critical design studies’, I will pay particularly attention to those that seem to imagine a new social role and modes of operation for design. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfpyy8882hy35avvwkg9gmm3))
- This part ends with the question of whether a ‘critical design studies’ field could be said to exist. The answer to it will depend on how we conceptualize the cultural background from which design practice emerges. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfpz9c991mt372y4r4ssfpkc))
- My argument is that we are witnessing the convergence of these tendencies into an ontological-political field that seeks to question anew, and go beyond, these dualisms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfpzbndrha5h4qsz3tzzpbr4))
- increasingly discussed at present around the notion of ‘relationality’-- ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfpzbzftzhg8n1qq116by1sb))
- do not come close to questioning its capitalistic nature. But many navigate in between, alternative between celebration and venturesome ideas and critiques (such as the well known woks by Bruce Mau, 2000, 2003; see also MoMA 2008).

- Design has doubtlessly been a central political technology of modernity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfpzqx7vw71hg7a9mwc4v5zf))
- A key question becomes: how does one design for a complex world? (Thackara 2004). Rather than keeping on filling the world with stuff, what design strategies will allows us –people—to have more meaningful and environmentally responsible lives? Living within a “Design Cluster” means that design becomes “a category beyond categories” (Lunenfeld 2003: 10), one that opens up a new space for linking theory, practice, and purpose, and vision and reality. This brings forth the endless project of discovering new territories for design through research ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfpzx7acxty001fnvs6dvr4v))
- These new principles summon to the discussion unprecedented methodological and epistemological issues, opening up a welcoming space for disciplines such as anthropology and geography. New methods highlight front-end research, with the designer as facilitator and mediator more than plain expert; conceive of design as eminently user-centered, participatory, collaborative, and radically contextual; seek to make the processes and structures that surround us intelligible and knowable so as to induce ecological and systems literacy among users; and so forth. Above all, going back to the normative question, there is an attempt to construct alternative cultural visions as drivers of social transformation through design. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfq08sxyga5zx5v2z1wc8e2c))
- As the Editorial to a recent issue of Design Studies devoted to the concept put it, the great popularity gained by design thinking outside the design professions stems precisely from the perception of design’s real or potential contribution to address ‘wicked’ problems and of design as an agent of change. This brings about a shift from the functional and semiotic emphasis of design to questions of experience and meaning.9 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfraktchbkyd9jpjqjjh0t12))
- the Design Studio for Social Intervention group in Boston, http://ds4si.org/storage/ds4si. Another interesting group in this vein is the School for Designing a Society, http://www.designingasociety.net/. There are other interesting hands-­‐on NGOs working explicitly on design for development and sustainability, again with various degrees of self awareness of ‘poking at the edges,’ largely in Europe or with international scope (see, e.g., the Center for Sustainable Design, cfsd.org.uk; the International Development Design Summit, http://iddsummit.org/; the Social Design Site, http://www.socialdesignsite.com/content/view/30/58/; Design that Matters, http://www.designthatmatters.org/; and Design for the World, http://www.designfortheworld.org. John Thackara’s Doors of Perception Conference is a good source of design debates with a critical edge world-­‐wide from within the profession, http://wp.doorsofperception.com/. Finally, there is an anthrodesign yahoo group, http://www.anthrodesign.com/Join_Us.html ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfranykgcbvc8aqwac612tda))
- A readily accepted principle is that ecological design involves the successful integration of human and natural systems and processes; whether this integration is largely based on learning from several billion years of evolution and on learning from nature’s designs themselves,17 or needs to rely on, and hence re-invent, technology to satisfy the contemporary situation and needs the starting point is that the environmental crisis is a design crisis and that humans need to change their practices radically to avert it. There are a number of shared notions, such as the belief that ecological sustainability goes well beyond technological and economic sustainability, and will ultimately be the work of an entirely new sustainable culture; ecology as the basis of the development of design competence for conservation, regeneration, and stewardship; seeding all socionatural systems with diversity and creating resilience through intelligent webs; and building on the self-organizing potential of natural and social systems.

- Ecological design changes the old rules about what counts for knowledge and who counts as knower.
  It suggests
  that sustainability is a cultural process rather than an expert one, and that we should all acquire a basic competence in the shaping of our world. … For too long we have expected the design professions to bend an inert world into shape. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfrbbqeveddfvsy69m61cyd0))
- the inevitable cultural embeddedness of all artifacts to suggest why design anthropology “is emerging as a methodology as much as a discourse” (Clarke ed. 2011:10). There is a critical bend to this position in that “contemporary critical designers, combining anthropological-style observation and speculation on emergent social practices” are developing new approaches, such as ‘prototyping the social’ and other ethnographic tropes in exploring ways to critically look at, and construct, our worlds, in more inclusive ways ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfrbk3s12e5481hb615f9vx0))

- the pervasive cultural background within which much of our contemporary world unfolds is ‘the rationalistic tradition.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfrh2jp6e05f749g6xdzjntg))
- The tradition we are talking about is variously referred to as ‘rationalistic,’ ‘Cartesian,’
  ‘objectivist,’ and often associated with related terms such as ‘mechanistic’ (worldview), ‘reductionistic’ (science), ‘positivistic’ (epistemologically) and, more recently, computationalist. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfrh4dvm2eaa142y7xac9v6d))

- The three main ones are Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, and Fernando Flores. Maturana and Varela are known as the originators, since the late 1960s, of the Chilean School of cognitivism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfrhbf97eafvew33tjryjpr3))
- language and reality, or representation/thought and ‘the real.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gfrh7a1kk7zmevc0ygpv0nbk))
- By linking cognition to experience, our authors lead us into an altogether different tradition. In this tradition, we recognize in a profound way that “the world is not something that is given to us but something we engage in by moving, touching, breathing, eating” (Varela 1999: 8). A number of consequences follow. The first is that while there is indeed a distinction between self and world in this view, there is also radical continuity between them (emphatically expressed in the dictum that there is an “unbroken coincidence of our being, our doing, and our knowing, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg43cz4ee4dmfktet71t47k6))
- Of particular interest for our concern with relationality and design is the argument that, by splitting cognition and affect and ideas from feelings in the interest of objectivity, science practice contributes to heighten modernity’s tendency towards pathologies of isolation , ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg449jsj1y33r75ra6c1hstm))
