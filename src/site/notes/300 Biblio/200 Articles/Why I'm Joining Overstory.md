- The cost of launching satellites has gone down considerably, so there has been a rapid rise in both the number of satellites being launched and the diversity of sensors on them. So the quality of satellite data is increasing while the cost of accessing it is decreasing. As a result, the Overstory engineers in Amsterdam are able to access high-resolution data about a specific square foot of land in rural California multiple times a day. Using their algorithms, they can determine what trees are growing, how fast they are growing and even what pests are eating the trees. Incredibly cool, right?
