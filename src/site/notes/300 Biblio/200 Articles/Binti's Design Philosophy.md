- trauma-informed practices. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtf2xft7jctmzmz3pjkyfrzr))
- spend more time focusing on children and less time on paperwork and documentation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtf2xkpbv4aa0qpjb08y61t8))
- building deep empathy for our users by shadowing them and interviewing them. Get a full picture by researching all perspectives: speak to youth, families of origin, foster families, relatives, adoptive families, workers, supervisors, and directors.

- Be ultra accessible
  1. We should ensure that the maximum number of people can use Binti. As government software we should be WCAG 2.1 and ADA compliant.
  2. Users may have language barriers - We know that many families of origin and relative parents interacting with the system do not have English as a first language - we want to support them to drive reunification and permanence.
  3. Mobile accessible - Caseworkers are often out in the field supporting children, helping foster families. Families or children may have no access to a desktop device.
  4. Slow network connectivity - Frequently foster families and ICWA families may be in rural areas or have poor access to internet, and workers may be out visiting these families to ensure children are on their way to reunification.
  5. Low tech/average tech - Our research shows that caseworkers may have been in their line of work for a long time and have less exposure to new technology. Software that workers currently use is typically outdated, 20+ years old. We also know relative foster families may not have access to computers, even commuting to the Library to complete their paperwork.
