- When I was approaching the age of forty and facing the type of cancer scares that have become so commonplace in women's lives they are practically routine, my first thought as I waited for test results was that I was not ready to die because I had not yet fo und the love my heart had been seeking.

- I spent years search-
  ing for a meaningful definition of the word "love," and
  was deeply relieved when I found one in psychiatrist
  M. Scott Peck's classic self-help book The Road Less
  Traveled, first published in 1978. Echoing the work of
  Erich Fromm, he defines love as "the will to extend one's
  self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's
  spiritual growth." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7t2n3e1c1y91nsx3qa9gyf))

  enabled me to survive acts of lovelessness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7t21rgqphvnd0bhn7dn3q7))
- To begin by always thinking of love as an action rather
  than a feeling is one way in which anyone using the word
  in this manner automatically assumes accountability and
  responsibility. We are often taught we have no control
  over our "feelings." Yet most of us accept that we choose
  our actions, that intention and will inform what we do.
  We also accept that our actions have consequences. To
  think of actions shaping fee lings is one way we rid our-
  selves of conventionally accepted assumptions such as that
  parents love their children, or that one simply "falls" in
  love without exercising will or choice, that there are such
  things as "crimes of passion," ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7t15jh41qd9fstxcqsq9wz))
- Definitions are vital starting points for the imagination.
  What we cannot imagine cannot come into being. A good
  definition marks our starting point and lets us know where
  we want to end up. As we move toward our desired des-
  tination we chart the journey, creating a map. We need a
  map to guide us on our journey to love-starting with the
  place where we know what we mean when we speak of
  love. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7t01qj5tnww6nzjmdhsmrf))
- In early adolescence when we were whipped
  and told that these punishments were "for our own good"
  or "I'm doing this because I love you," my siblings and I
  were confused. Why was harsh punishment a gesture of
  love? As children do, we pretended to accept this grown-
  up logic; but we knew in our hearts it was not right. We
  knew it was a lie. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7tbhgh8hzdqgh5dthxhtmp))
- On the flip side there are masses of children who grow
  up confident love is a good feeling who are never pun-
  ished, who are allowed to believe that love is only about
  getting your needs met, your desires satisfied. In their
  child's minds love is not about what they have to give,
  love is mostly something given to them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7tc1wtpsvj6fpa8rwd3jzh))
- Both groups
  have learned to think about love primarily in relation to
  good feelings, in the context of reward and punishment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7tcjyfnhaj2h2mrrdwpve0))
- From early childhood on, most of us remember being told
  we were loved when we did things pleasing to our parents. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7tcvyr58ysmppsk5b8a0qg))
- As children grow they associate love more
  with acts of attention, affection, and caring. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7td2652c20sm49bpc0pr95))
- The no-
  tion that love is about getting what one wants, whether
  it's a hug or a new sweater or a trip to Disneyland, is a
  way of thinking about love that makes it difficult for chil-
  dren to acquire a deeper emotional understanding. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7tej1mjhcvmd4q6jrrcpmh))
- In
  our culture the private family dwelling is the one institu-
  tionalized sphere of power that can easily be autocratic
  and fascisti c. As absolute rulers, parents can usually decide
  without any intervention what is best for their children. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7tgs4mtf65sfm627ehjq0m))
- I wanted
  the group to acknowledge that being physically hurt or
  abused by grown-ups when we are children has harmful
  consequences in our adult life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7tm15zen2zh3hayr92355r))
- One of the most important social myths we must de-
  bunk if we are to become a more loving culture is the one
  that teaches parents that abuse and neglect can coexist
  with love. Abuse and neglect negate love. Care and affir-
  mation, the opposite of abuse and humiliation, are the
  foundation of love ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7tpbt48yc0065nhxgg1yhy))
- Many of the men who offer their personal testimony in
  Boyhood, Growing Up Male tell stories of random violent
  abuse by parents that inflicted trauma. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7tq2x1w4qtaf9sbmse766q))
- Shelby expresses contradictory understandings about the
  meaning of love. On the one hand, he says: "I have no
  doubt that my father loved me, but his love became mis-
  directed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7tqqrz49ckd4878v9p13e7))
- As the intensity of the pain of his hits increased,
  I felt the hurt in my heart. I realized what hurt me the
  most were my feelings of love for this man who was hit-

  abound, children suffer emotional neglect and abuse. I ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7ttkccn02ra9fvbhnp0mn0))
- Organizing the men for group discussion,
  Masters writes: "I spoke to them of the pain I had carried
  through more than a dozen institutions. And I explained
  how all these events ultimately trapped me in a pattern of
  lashing out against everything." Like many abused chil -
  dren, male and female, these men were beaten by mothers,
  fathers, and other parental caregivers." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7tzq2p0d2bgb6wv6tjezzn))
- Being hurt by parenting adults
  rarely alters a child's desire to love and be loved by them.
  Among grown-ups who were wounded in childhood, the
  desire to be loved by uncaring parents persists, even when
  there is a clear acceptance of the reality that this love will
  never be forthcomi ng. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7v0jr165g9shntsdqzm5my))
- In the prologue to Creating Love, John Bradshaw calls
  this confusion about love "mystification." He shares: " I
  was brought up to believe that love is rooted in blood
  relationships. You naturally loved anyone in your family.
  Love was not a choice. The love I learned about was
  bound by duty and obligation . . . . My family taught me
  our culture's rules and beliefs about love . .. even with the
  best intentions our parents often confused love with what
  we would now call abuse." To demystify the meaning of
  love, the art and practice of loving, we need to use sound
  definitions of love when talking with children, and we a lso
  need to ensure that loving action is never tainted with
  abuse. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7v260yp7c20t9gx3xerafp))
- it is absolutely crucial that parenting adults learn
  how to offer loving discipline . Setting boundaries and
  teaching children how to set boundaries for themselves
  prior to misbehavior is an essential part of loving parent-
  ing. When parents start out disciplining children by using
  punishment, this becomes the pattern children respond to.
  Loving parents work hard to discipline without punish-
  ment. This does not mean that they never punish, only
  that when they do punish, they choose punishments like
  time-outs or the taking away of privileges. They focus on
  teaching children how to be self-disciplining and how to
  take responsibility for their actions. Since the vast majority
  of us were raised in households where punishment was
  deemed the primary, if not the only, way to teach disci-
  pline, the fact that discipline can be taught without pun-
  ishment surprises many people. One of the simplest ways
  children learn discipline is by learning how to be orderly
  in daily life, to clean up any messes they make. Just teach-
  ing a child to take responsibility for placing toys in the
  appropriate place after playtime is one way to teach re-
  sponsibility and self-discipline . ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg7v66jkf303t4ts7qswzqm7))
