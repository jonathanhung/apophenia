> The day-by-day experience of a managed existence leads us all to take a world of fictitious substances for granted. It leads us to speak about these managed phantoms with new words like 'progress' in health care, universal education, global consciousness, social development; with words that suggest something 'better,' 'scientific,' 'modern,' 'advanced,' 'beneficial to the poor.' The verbal amoebas by which we designate the management-bred phantoms thus connote self-important enlightenment, social concern and rationality without however denoting anything which we could ourselves taste, smell or experience. In this semantic desert full of muddled echoes we need a Linus blanket, some prestigious fetish that we can drag around to feel like decent defenders of sacred values.
