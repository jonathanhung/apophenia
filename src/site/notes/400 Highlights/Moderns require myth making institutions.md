Only within the matrix which Jacques Ellul calls the 'technological system' has this new type of human condition come to full fruition. A new role opens for mythmaking, moralizing, legitimizing institutions, a role which cannot quite be understood in terms of old religions, but which some churches rush in to fill. The new technological society is singularly incapable of generating myths to which people can form deep and rich attachments. Yet, for its rudimentary maintenance it needs agencies which create legitimate fetishes to which epistemic sentimentality can attach itself. At no previous time was there a similar demand for agencies capable of rendering such a service.
