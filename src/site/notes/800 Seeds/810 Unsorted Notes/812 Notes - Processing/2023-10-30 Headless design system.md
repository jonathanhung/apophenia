Headless component + Design tokens = themed component

**Library structure in [[Figma\|Figma]]**
Library structure in Figma is suggested to be multiple files, single file components.

Pros: 
- Helps with versioning, 
- helps with linking to JIRA tasks, etc. 
- Symmetry where Figma mirrors front-end

Black covers are components, white ones indicate patterns
