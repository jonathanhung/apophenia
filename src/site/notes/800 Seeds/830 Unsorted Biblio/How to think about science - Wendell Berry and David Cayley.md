## Insights

What is admirable about a form of agricultural science is a courtesy of one towards the place it studies , and second a mystery towards that which it does not know. An ignorance towards its own promise.

Specialization is fine but its danger is being unaware of the ends you are being used.

Science is not knowledge that has a sense of "propriety". When you walk into a room where someone has died you know what not to say. Appropriateness or context awareness. Human knowledge applied is always about local adaptation. 

Science or medicine is always sharing an absolute or abstraction and your job as a patient is to advocate for your own particularities.
