- The tale is told in the Gospel of Luke, when Jesus is asked, who is my neighbor? He responds with a story about the rescue of a Jew by a Samaritan, an outsider to the religion which was centered on the Temple in Jerusalem.
  To Illich, the parable perfectly illustrates the unforeseen horizons that Jesus hoped to open for His listeners. But the interpretations that have generally been applied to this story, he says, point in the opposite direction. Some thirty years ago, I went into sermons from the early third century into the nineteenth century dealing with this story of the Samaritan, and I found out that most preachers, when
  they comment on that passage, comment on it in order to show how we ought to behave towards our neighbor, when in fact this is the opposite of what Jesus, who tells that story of the Samaritan, wanted to point out. The Pharisees came to ask Him, “Master, Teacher, tell us who is my neighbor?”
  They didn’t ask him, “how does one behave to one’s neighbor?” They asked him, point blank, the question: “Who is the guy whom you call neighbor?” And he, as a story, told them a man was going down to Jericho, fell among robbers, was beaten up and left wounded. A teacher goes by, a priest goes by, sees him and walks on.
  And then an outsider comes along, the traditional enemy, and turns to the wounded man, as an internal turning, and picks him up, takes him into his arms and brings him to the inn. So he answers them, “My neighbor is whom I decide, not whom I have to choose.” There is no way of categorizing who my neighbor ought to be.
  This doctrine about the neighbor which this guy, Jesus, brings into conversation, is utterly destructive of ordinary decency, of ethical behavior and to say this today is as surprising as it was at the beginning. The teaching of Jesus in this parable is destructive of ethical decency because of the way in which it shows and commends the violation of a sacrosanct boundary between those to whom I belong and
  to whom I have an obligation, and those others who arrange things in their own way and ought not to be my concern. If the story were told today, as Illich has sometimes pointed out, it would re-acquire its power to shock by showing a Palestinian caring for an injured Jew. The Samaritan does not what he ought to do, as the preachers Illich consulted argued, but precisely what he ought not to do.
  Ethics, traditionally, were formed within an ethnic boundary that gave them shape and substance. Jesus, Illich says, indicated a different, more open-ended possibility. The Master told them who your neighbor is is not determined by your birth, by your condition, by the language which you speak, by the ethnos, which means really the mode of walking which
  has become proper to you, but by you. You can recognize the other man who is out of bounds culturally, who is foreign linguistically, who — you can say by providence or by pure chance — is the one who lies somewhere along
  your road in the grass and create the supreme form of relatedness which is not given by creation but created by you. This voluntary, created relationship, Illich stresses, cannot be made into an abstract or universal duty. It is a free, unconditioned response and, as such, cannot be converted into an ethical
  norm or rule. What the Samaritan undertakes, by its very nature, is a concrete, specific bodily tie between two people. This is not a spiritual relationship. This is an act which prolongs the Incarnation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hctr5qkggct7pqn9zz59mtfb))
