>> The intensity of the paradox of good guys / bad guys will be so pronounced, I hope that the frame will crumble under its own weight. It's so abhorrent to pick a good guy or bad guy in this conflict.

>> The idea of the Holy Land is only possible in an axial religion. And it makes sense that all of the major axial religions of the world have their home in this particular geographical area. They are effectively saying: the rest of the land is not holy, this land is holy. And we are in a conflict to the death over the control over the holiness of this land. 

>> And that makes (the Israeli-Palestine conflict) a focalization of **the effect of taking God out of matter, of de-sacralizing the rest of the world and our relationships between each other**. And having only one source of truth, and having a dominance-culture-based war over who controls that "land that is holy". And in that way, this conflict is a dark mirror for all these aspects of "The story of Separation and Dominance"... the separation of God and Matter.


Charles friend, Cynthia jores, traveled the world burying these earth treasure vases. From a Tibetan master, 106 yo, in Nepal. Clay vessels to plant into places that are most war torn (Congo, Liberia, Rwanda). What rational good is this? 

But peace breaks out, vigils break out. There are prayers in there. But also, the most poor and destitute, the hungry. They give up money, their only dollar, for peace.

What are we willing to give up, relinquish, for peace? What is the precious coin to put in there for peace? We are being called to affirm or deny what we want. What is our sacrifice? 
- Narratives of othering, in anger. 
- Self righteousness
- Vengeance punishing.
- Being a victim (the right, the pityable victim)

> I notice I have done this, particularly when I provoke the reaction that will come when I poke the bear in the right way. Illicit the bad guy response. And in that I am complicit in this, I am not seeing the innocent child in this person. I am trying to prove myself right, by making them the bad guy. 
> That's where I am willing to take responsibility. To holding the fundamental innocence of others, and seeing them in that light. Even when I am most tempted to "call out" their darkness or their oppressor, instead of staying in connection with that innocent part of them that doesn't fit into that box that I want to put them into. To create a story I want to tell about myself.
