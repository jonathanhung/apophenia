1.

Understand, I am always trying to figure out  
what the soul is,  
and where hidden,  
and what shape  
and so, last week,  
when I found on the beach  
the ear bone  
of a pilot whale that may have died  
hundreds of years ago, I thought  
maybe I was close  
to discovering something  
for the ear bone

2.

is the portion that lasts longest  
in any of us, man or whale; shaped  
like a squat spoon  
with a pink scoop where  
once, in the lively swimmer's head,  
it joined its two sisters  
in the house of hearing,  
it was only  
two inches long  
and thought: the soul  
might be like this  
so hard, so necessary

3.

yet almost nothing.  
Beside me  
the gray sea  
was opening and shutting its wave-doors,  
unfolding over and over  
its time-ridiculing roar;  
I looked but I couldn't see anything  
through its dark-knit glare;  
yet don't we all know, the golden sand  
is there at the bottom,  
though our eyes have never seen it,  
nor can our hands ever catch it

4.

lest we would sift it down  
into fractions, and facts  
certainties  
and what the soul is, also  
I believe I will never quite know.  
Though I play at the edges of knowing,  
truly I know  
our part is not knowing,  
but looking, and touching, and loving,  
which is the way I walked on,  
softly,  
through the pale-pink morning light.
