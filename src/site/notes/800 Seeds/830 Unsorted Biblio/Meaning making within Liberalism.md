## Notes

Liberalism gives no inherent meaning but we are free to define virtue for ourself.

What's the objection to this relationship to liberal meaning making? 

It feels weaker than state or religiously imposed meaning. 

In defense of imposed religion: we are like children? Aristotles view of virtues: you don't explain concepts of virtues to children, or get buy in. You compel them to act virtuously and habit will be instilled and come to understand the value over time. Similarly "forced meanings" eg religions come inherited but they are eventually understood to have deep wisdom

Lindy effect

Liberalism says fundamentally there's no one definition of the good. So there's no paternalistic access to the idea of the good that can be bestowed.

The difference between big M meaning (war, gods, nation) and small m. People don't think that's meaningful enough. Napoleon criticized England as a nation of merchants. As if serving our neighbors was not good enough. 

Challenge with liberalism is that it's harder to find meaning it doesn't get handed out. 

It's hard to be told "you could be anything" paradox of choice. 

How do you cultivate autonomous citizens who are capable of making choices / finding their own bliss? 
- cultivation of autonomy as a [[generator function\|generator function]] of good society

Education towards autonomy is a different type of education. The problem with education is that it creates conformity (to a standard) not autonomy.

Liberalism allows space to ask yourself what do you care about, and how that relates to your life. 

Critiques of liberalism state that transcending self or self sacrifice is inherent meaningful. However the mistake is, some people think they can decide for others how to achieve self transcendence. 

Liberalism allows a pick and choose for the dopamine hit. And there's an abundance of options of book club etc. 

People who lament the death of meaning sounds like it's a dessert or empty landscape. Nothing and nobody. But it's not describing the experience, actually we have an over abundance of meaning, too many commodities in late stage capitalism. Buy me, it's this. 

People are afraid you will choose the wrong thing, and believe very confidently believe they know the right thing. (Faith or nationalism). Strong men want to provide "the answer" and feel others won't be fulfilled by ordinary life. 

Going back to the small things: 
They are fundamentally skeptical of everyday life, they think that life has to be triumphant, that there needs to be a mythic overture or cause, and that there's honor or glory in it. And that shows an inability to draw value from ordinary life.

Napoleon called Britain a nation of shop keepers. That there's a lack of value in providing for your family and going about business of your day. That in order to be valuable you have to kill and go to war. A fundamental mythology where meaning only comes where ordinary drops away and we are the characters in a play drawn into a grand drama. That shows a fundamental lack of vision of the many types of meaning. 

There is hucksterism but it's vastly preferable to be sweet talked into something than to be forced. Consumerism is better than coercion.

Lot of people make false promises. And some of it is about cultivating habits, turning to wisdom about what we know will make us happy. Lindy effect. Gratitude. Talmud "who is the happy man? The one who is happy with what he has" cultivated satisfaction before going after more, enjoy what you have access to.

### liberal traditionalism
We chose traditionalism. Reacting to the fact that their life is being more marginalized or smaller

Simplifying 

Cosmos and taxxis. Hayek. Abstract processes and mechanization. Taxis is small local relationships. We want simple and easy to understand relationships.
