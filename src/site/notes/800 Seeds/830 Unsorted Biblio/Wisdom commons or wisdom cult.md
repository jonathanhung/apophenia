## Notes
---

Problem with modernity. 

Social status is gamed through signaling instead of genuine power and authority within a given community. 

You keep hopping into communities and play their game hope to accrue enough with one community. 

Obviously money plays all status games in all communities. Followers etc

Gurus feel like they can sell wisdom.

Warnings: 
metaphor filled soliloquy's to appear wise

Meta crisis: don't gaslight people into your cult with a meaning crisis

Appear wise continuously is an addiction . 

Snowden: wisdom can only be known in retrospect. You can't teach wisdom that denies epistemic sovereignty.

You would traditionally become wise through devotion and a master gardener over time. 

Economic imaginary, a fiction or idea before a reality. 80s were full of these experiments. Is this utopia, a cult?

Desire to save people, to help others? The saved and the damned. Doesn't make me a savior.

42:26

Wisdom emergent property of expertise within a community or context. Teachers lost it in the 80s because teaching to the test. Systems thinking blamed / engineering mindset - like you have to define the outcome at the start. 

Complexity - focus on good inputs not outputs. Small things at hyper local level. 

Can't define the future state. Guru space thinking they can sell wisdom,

--

Wisdom and sense making is a process or verb. Memoir writers, you want to wait 15-20 years before you write. Natural transcendent move is happening when you take enough perspectives, you sound transcended and clear view. 

--

Rules: only way life happens is outside the rules. Something about Pareto, Gaussian. Log scales. Who makes decisions in an organization?

Transcendent ideologies are dangerous bc usually those meta perspectives are gained through experience. 

Used to be Enough feedback loops in a small group society, certain levels of insanity can't happen. But now online we aren't with olfactory senses, trusting. We are now online and getting isolated.

Communities put you in your place, see yourself in a different perspective. Putting board member of a bank as a grocery clerk.

--

Qualities versus criteria. 
Could success be measured? In these projects I want different attitudes. No saviors. No over ascribing meaning. 

-- 

Be surrounded by people who can disagree with you. A cult leader is surrounded by yes men. Be a leader by leading in threes.

Take retreats to consolidate. Is there a wisdom Incubator? for new culture to develop, needs a strong membrane. 

--

Elders need to distribute power, but if there's only one you can't. Ground through direct experience.

--

Tyranny emerges out of someone trying to be transcendent (entrepreneurial), wisdom / knowledge (expert), reproduction. 

--

Do we need correctives or rules? 
The sage on a stage is just an emergent property of a system of chimps. 
Ritualized or access so that no one is the holy one. Rotational leadership responsibility. No more adulation for you, CEO sage. 

Grounded ecology, in relationship. Ethical relationship with individuals in context. No ecstatic. Short term proximal ethical interactions.

Experimental roles , theatre, you can try out different roles. Wear the clothing in a context and I put it aside that's not all of me.

--

Incubators try to experiment these new relations and eventually they encode this into ideology. Cults make voluntary commitments to ideology instead of just working together.

Gandhi - spin thread. Quakers wanted to make things, raise a barn. The world is stubborn.

Conveniences create parasitic cults. We need functioning making stuff where rubber meets road. Don't live in fantasy land but making stuff.

--

Peace and reconciliation Snowden. Work on things 3-5 people, reflect on it when it becomes a problem. Can't have conversations when it's too big, no common goal or too big.
