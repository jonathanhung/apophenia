There's a problem with the type of mind that's being domesticated or cultivated by our education system. 

Factory model of schooling. Training American citizens. Civil rights movement. In our schools we were able to express democracy, Sputnik and space race created mass bureaucracy.

Then 80s/90s went from civil religion to gates era enthropic investment. School to startup school, invest in digital. 

21st schools for skills in digital economy. Individuated workers.

I think the root is the economic incentives. 

Being an influencer is more important than being a thinker. Shift in cultural value
