Bonnitta is Alfred north whitehead's spiritual kin? 

Bonnitta origin story: 
is upset with doctrine with sutta, science. Discordant with the edge of what she knew. 
We are still with the same models and understanding of reality, nothings changed since we predicted civilization would collapse. She has been living in perpetual shock that nothings changed, a despair. And a love of the world, we have all this! And we've done nothing to deserve it.
Bonnie was taught prayer young (3) and was confused, in that she had to "speak" to god instead of experience it directly. Or apologize or lie to god. 
Bonnitta learned about cultural codes of institutions. Appearances and reality distinctions. People always made reference to "the real".

Bard: Whitehead and deleuze is the only good thing in 20th century philosophy. Anthropology and metaphysics meet in B. Anthropology and psychoanalysis are the only 20th century disciplines relevant to metaphysics / philosophy. 

Bard endears Jung, Kant, Freud and anthropologists. To understand technology we have to understand ourselves. 

Bonnitta considers herself an American pragmatist. Bard says Deleuze says perce james Dewey were geniuses; nietzsche was a pragmatist. 

Bard: Metaphysics is difficult because we become our own archetype, we see through a certain lens. No one can afford to be a generalist. Metaphysics is ultimate generalist. Kill a lot of axioms about what the world is. 

Shamanoid has to be curious and love to be wrong and kill your own axioms, to see on the other side what you cannot see. 

Deleuze and pragmatists : shit happens. What kinda shit is there and what does it mean that it happens? Past and future. Present is perspectival, a social construction (pragmatic)

Bonnitta: 
There's a psychological metaphysics of pragmatism. But there's also an educational tradition... you start to see a wall in a discipline because the question cannot be framed in the logic or constraint of that discipline. 

Is there a new way of understanding reality, metaphysical creation that are Petri dishes. 

American pragmatists are about learning but also about experience in a very naive way. Where education gets in the way of an experience in the world.
